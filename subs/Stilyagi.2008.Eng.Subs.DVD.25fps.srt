00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,460
A special thank you to Mihail Prohorov
for supporting this film.

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,340
Next.

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,340
- May I come in?
- Yes.

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,940
What's your complaint?

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,060
Cough.

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,620
Cough? Strong one?

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,580
Yeah.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,060
Dry or with mucus?

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,260
Dry one.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,780
- Undress.
- It's hard to breathe.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,380
Ok, I see.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,340
Undressed? Go to the desk.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,860
- Do you smoke?
- Yes.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,540
A lot?

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,580
Yeah.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,780
Ohh, you should quit smoking.

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,300
Yeah, I know.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,300
Inhale.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,140
Hold your breath.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,100
You can breathe.

26
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,060
Obstructive bronchitis.

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,380
Pneumonia...

31
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,420
Come from that side.

32
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,780
Elena, Slava - over there.

33
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,460
Lyuba, give me the tool.

34
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,940
How disgusting!

35
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,940
Raid!!!

36
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,020
Cut-cut-cut!

37
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,780
Get your hands off my shoes!
You don't have the right!

38
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,580
Mels!

39
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,540
Can you walk?

40
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,820
Hurts a lot!

41
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,260
So can you walk?

42
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,580
I'll go fetch the guys.

43
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,420
Don't.

44
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,980
I probably broke my leg.

45
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,700
All because of you.

46
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,380
Okay.

47
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,940
Get up.

48
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,260
Get up, get up.

49
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,020
What's your name?

50
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,420
Mels.

51
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,620
And you?

52
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,380
Polina.

53
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,340
Polly.

54
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,300
For those who know me,
Good Time Polly.

55
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,700
Why Good Time?

56
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,700
You'll see.

57
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,980
Now you know.

58
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,060
Come to Broadway.
You'll have a good time.

59
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,860
What a nice evening...

60
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,060
Why do some people not want to live
like everyone else?

61
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,020
So how did it happen, Mels?

62
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,180
I didn't run her down.

63
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,060
You? The athletic champion
of our department?

64
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,820
I am telling you, Katya...

65
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,660
I stumbled and fell into the water.

66
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,580
It can happen to anybody.

67
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,260
I just don't understand why you are taking it so lightly? "I didn't run her down!"

68
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,980
We are not playing a game of tag here.

69
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,660
Every stilyaga is a potential criminal.

70
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,940
It's only one step
from saxophone to the knife.

71
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,140
Know what, Commissar...

72
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,660
I probably better file a written report
about it tomorrow?

73
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,500
About how I ran, how I stumbled and fell into the water...

74
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,140
Alright, Mels, why are you so?
I was being your friend.

75
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,780
Don't take it so hard.

76
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,820
We'll find that stilyaga door mat.
She won't get away.

77
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,860
<i>The man and the cat are
crying by the window,</i>

78
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,660
<i>Grey rain is coming down
on to the window.</i>

79
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,420
<i>The E.R. is coming
to the man and the cat.</i>

80
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,500
<i>The poor man is sick to his head.</i>

81
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,580
<i>The doctor is coming, coming through the snowy plain.</i>

82
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,460
<i>He is bringing the healing powder
for the people.</i>

83
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,820
<i>The man and the cat will
take that powder,</i>

84
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,660
<i>And their grief and melancholy
will subside.</i>

85
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,500
<i>The man and the cat can
hardly count the days,</i>

86
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,260
<i>Instead of the blue sky
a grey ceiling is above them.</i>

87
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,300
<i>The man and the cat go
flying at night,</i>

88
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,300
<i>But it's only a dream and it doesn't
grow them real wings.</i>

89
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,060
<i>The doctor is coming, coming through the snowy plain.</i>

90
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,620
<i>He is bringing the healing powder
for the people.</i>

91
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,220
<i>The man and the cat will
take that powder,</i>

92
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,020
<i>And their grief and melancholy
will subside.</i>

93
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,660
<i>Where are you? Where are you? The white ambulance.</i>

94
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,980
<i>The man is screaming
inside his shanty abode.</i>

95
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,860
<i>But the walls are deaf,
the pipes are like veins,</i>

96
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,980
<i>And the toilet cistern beats fast
like a heart.</i>

97
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,300
<i>The doctor is coming, coming through the snowy plain.</i>

98
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,580
<i>He is bringing the healing powder
for the people.</i>

99
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,020
<i>The man and the cat will
take that powder,</i>

100
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,860
<i>And their grief and melancholy
will subside.</i>

101
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,780
Where have you been all night again?

102
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,140
On night duty.

103
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,580
Come here, sit.

104
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,300
Don't start again, mom...

105
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,420
Can't you understand that I'll be fired?

106
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,740
That I'll go sweep the yard...
That is if I can be trusted with a broom...

107
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,940
How can I manage people,

108
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,980
when in my own home
I have raised a spy.

109
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,260
For 10 years after the death of your father...

110
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,100
I didn't so much as look at a man.
Where are your despicable clothes?

111
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,180
Where is your American trash?
I'll throw it out! I'll burn it!

112
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,980
I'll make you go naked outside!

113
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,780
You have everything.
What else do you need?

114
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,900
Ungrateful swine you are.
For what did I bring you up?!

115
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,980
For you to flash with your undies from underneath the skirt?!

116
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,780
What are you looking at? What are you looking at?
You, little bitch!

117
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,500
Haven't I whipped you enough? Huh?

118
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,980
I should've beaten you till you bleed!

119
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,180
Tanya, come to Broadway with us.
I've invited you a hundred times.

120
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,940
No. no. I can't.

121
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,620
Alright.

122
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,340
Just look at her!

123
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,140
This is outrageous!

124
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,340
What kind of Soviet woman is that?

125
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,380
Calm down, people! Calm down!
This is not a circus!

126
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,660
BROADWAY

127
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,860
Would you just look at yourself?
You look like a parrot!

128
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,420
Are you a Komsomol member or what?

129
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,540
I work two shifts at the factory!
And here you are idling!

130
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,500
Whoops...

131
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,620
Look, he came all by himself.

132
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,460
Dudes!
Do you have any scissors?

133
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,860
We need to return a favor.

134
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,580
He has nothing to cut there!

135
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,140
At least a clamp of hair
from a mangy mare!

136
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,140
I've been invited.

137
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,620
Who invited you?

138
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,180
Polly.

139
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,580
She called me, so I came.

140
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,380
Well, hello.

141
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,700
Hi.

142
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,860
Are you okay?

143
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,180
Yes.

144
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,780
It seemed to me that yesterday
you slipped a little.

145
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,820
You were seeing things.

146
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,860
Alright.

147
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,660
Bye.

148
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,700
Be careful, you'll get poisoned.

149
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,940
Guard the car.

150
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,100
- Hi!
- Hi!

151
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,540
Glad to see you.

152
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,580
Hi, baby.

153
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,980
Hey, what's this going on here? Huh?

154
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,260
Why are you harassing him?
He's quite a harmless little square.

155
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,180
Let's go to "KOK"!

156
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,220
Dryn! Leave him alone! Let's go.

157
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,100
Hey, guys! I'm with you!

158
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,260
<i>You...</i>

159
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,460
<i>From the height...</i>

160
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,580
<i>Of your beauty pedestal...</i>

161
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,620
<i>Don't notice me.</i>

162
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,060
<i>But...</i>

163
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,740
<i>I'll be able to</i>

164
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,220
<i>Make you</i>

165
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,220
<i>Get to know me better.</i>

166
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,580
<i>Even if today I am a nobody,</i>

167
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,660
<i>Even if they keep telling you
that I'm not the one.</i>

168
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,380
<i>But!</i>

169
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
<i>Give me this day,</i>

170
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,700
<i>Give me this night,</i>

171
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,620
<i>Give me just one chance!</i>

172
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,900
<i>And you'll realize,</i>

173
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,100
<i>That I'm the goods.</i>

174
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,420
<i>Give me this day,</i>

175
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,420
<i>Give me this night,</i>

176
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,300
<i>Give me just one chance</i>

177
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,500
<i>You won't sleep</i>

178
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,740
<i>Until I'm with you.</i>

179
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,140
Interested in something?

180
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,660
You can get the rest here.

181
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,580
Password is: "Does uncle Yosya work here?"

182
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,780
Reply: "Uncle Yosya is long retired."

183
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,140
Key words: "I'm from Nolik".
Nolik is me.

184
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,900
"I'm from Nolik, Nolik is me".

185
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Nolik is me.
And You are from Nolik.

186
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,020
<i>Hey,</i>

187
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,060
<i>Regret...</i>

188
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,300
<i>That you've never met...</i>

189
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,540
<i>Such guys before.</i>

190
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,860
Excuse me, please.

191
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,500
Does uncle Yosya work here?

192
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,660
Uncle Yosya has long retired.

193
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,140
<i>But...</i>

194
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,100
<i>For you...</i>

195
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,980
<i>I'll change myself...</i>

196
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,420
<i>And I'll start everything from the beginning.</i>

197
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,300
<i>Even if today I am a nobody,</i>

198
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,540
<i>Even if they keep telling you
that I'm not the one.</i>

199
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,580
<i>But!</i>

200
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>Give me this day,</i>

201
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,340
<i>Give me this night,</i>

202
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,300
<i>Give me just one chance...</i>

203
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,500
<i>And you'll realize...</i>

204
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,700
<i>That I'm the goods.</i>

205
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,980
<i>Give me this day,</i>

206
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
<i>Give me this night,</i>

207
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,940
<i>Give me just one chance...</i>

208
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,860
<i>You won't sleep...</i>

209
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,420
<i>Until I'm with you.</i>

210
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,420
Let me go! You have no right!

211
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,620
Quiet, be quiet.

212
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,900
Don't be afraid.

213
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,660
What's your name?

214
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,580
- Bob.
- What?

215
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,900
Boris.

216
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,900
Boris Moiseevich Toiter.

217
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,940
I'm Mels.

218
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,900
Listen, Bob.

219
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,100
I want to ask you something.

220
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,380
Teach me to dance stylish.

221
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,900
Screw you!

222
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,620
Understand, you are the only guy I know among your people.

223
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,060
Oh, really?
It was a nice introduction to be sure.

224
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,260
Is it so hard for you?
Two squats, three claps.

225
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,540
Listen, Bob...

226
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,260
I won't leave you alone.

227
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,860
Bob, you'll be seeing me in your nightmares. Understand?

228
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
What is a dance?

229
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,500
A dance is the rhythmic
movement of bodies.

230
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,140
For example, the wien or classical waltz.

231
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,620
Vertebrate dislocation...

232
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,740
- Whose?
- Doesn't matter.

233
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,780
It's a three-beat movement with concurrent rotation around the partner.

234
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,380
Jazz unlike the classical styles is...

235
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,620
Get to the point!

236
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,500
Alright.

237
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,020
There are three main styles: atomic, Canadian and double Hamburg.

238
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,460
Can we skip the theory?

239
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,220
Okay. You're the guy, I'm the girl.
Let's go!

240
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,260
Hands off!
Paw the gals, not me!

241
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,500
How do I do it?

242
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,980
Like this.

243
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,620
<i>First of all.
Where are you putting your hands?</i>

244
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,380
<i>You'll get a slap from a chick, if you're coming on this way.</i>

245
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,940
<i>Start with the right leg.
Hold yourself straight.</i>

246
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,660
<i>Move your legs and do not babble!</i>

247
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,940
<i>Feel free...</i>

248
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,260
- An athlete?
- Yes.

249
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,820
<i>Now squat a little... and twist!</i>

250
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,340
Here you don't need to be
stronger, faster, higher.

251
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,460
Here you need... drive.

252
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,260
An energy. From within.

253
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,220
<i>...I like boogie-woogie and I'm dancing boogie-woogie every day.</i>

254
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,660
<i>To be a real stilyaga,</i>

255
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,420
<i>Buddy, you need to dance well.</i>

256
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,020
<i>You must know what Canadian style is.</i>

257
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,660
<i>It's all serious here,
it's no polka or quadrille.</i>

258
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,140
<i>There's the atomic style and also the hamburg-triple style...</i>

259
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,700
<i>Try to learn it, buddy,
you've got what it takes!</i>

260
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,500
<i>You like boogie-woogie.</i>

261
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,300
<i>You like boogie-woogie.</i>

262
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
<i>You like boogie-woogie.</i>

263
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,700
<i>You like boogie-woogie.</i>

264
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,060
<i>You like boogie-woogie,
and you're dancing boogie-woogie every day!</i>

265
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,300
Hello.

266
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,340
Son...

267
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,060
What are you doing in this house
in our absence?

268
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,060
We were just dancing.

269
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,540
In a country where you can't even sneeze loudly
without violating the criminal code...

270
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,940
He is just dancing.

271
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,020
After all, criminal prosecution for
"idolization of  the West" has not been abolished.

272
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,300
Please, look at yourself in the mirror.

273
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,780
Even your hairdo
is in violation of this law.

274
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,540
Alright.

275
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,420
Who was that young man?

276
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,940
My acquaintance.

277
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,060
Why are you so trustful?

278
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,820
Borya...

279
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,100
This young man has the attractive appearance of a KGB agent.

280
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,780
But why do we have to suspect everyone?

281
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,180
Do you know what this is?
And why it is here?

282
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,500
It's the basic necessities for a person imprisoned in a preliminary detention facility.

283
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,300
Uncle Adolf went to prison only because he had a politically incorrect name.

284
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,340
Aunt Fira was arrested...

285
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,820
Because she hung Stalin's portrait across from the bathroom door.

286
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,540
I never even got an explanation for
why I was imprisoned.

287
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,260
But that experience...

288
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,540
I will remember for the rest of my life.

289
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,860
But Dad! It is impossible to live like this!

290
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,500
With this locked door,
with this damned suitcase!

291
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,340
You're a doctor
you should understand!

292
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,700
This endless oppression
may lead to insanity!

293
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,540
- Borya...
- What, Mom?

294
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,060
If you don't care about yourself,
at least have pity on me and your father!

295
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,940
Sonny, the pants aren't too tight?

296
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,620
You should try...

297
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,780
using silicate glue.

298
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,460
Or what if it begins to rain all of a sudden?
Or a street sprinkler goes on?

299
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,140
And... it all falls apart.

300
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,540
- Mels.
- What?

301
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,460
Have you gone nuts?

302
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,340
What's wrong?

303
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,940
A crisis hits USA economy.

304
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,540
Are you going outside like this?

305
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,300
Of course. Or was I unloading night trains for nothing?

306
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,060
Father, tell him!

307
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,060
What? I like it!

308
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,300
We also used to play dress up in the village to scare the girls.

309
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,740
We dressed so freaky,
people would stutter from fright.

310
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,820
Hello.

311
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,300
Hello, Misha.

312
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,820
Hello.

313
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,940
Hello.

314
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,860
Hello, Vitek!

315
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,300
You won't see me with a stilyaga!

316
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,460
Alright, Lena, remember that
next time you ask me to fix your bike.

317
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,940
Stilyaga! Stilyaga!

318
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,260
Stilyaga! Stilyaga!

319
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,540
Stilyaga! Stilyaga!

320
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,980
COCKTAILS CLUB (KOK)

321
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,220
- Guys, who are we waiting for?
- I don't know.

322
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,660
Look...

323
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,700
He's looking like a human being now.

324
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,340
As the bourgeois writer
Anton Chehov used to say...

325
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,500
Drop by drop you should squeeze the square out of yourself.

326
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,220
Dude!

327
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,740
Dude!

328
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,140
"Made in Tambov?"

329
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,660
Remind me, I think I have an extra one somewhere. I'll bring it.

330
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,780
Fred.

331
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,780
Mels.

332
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,220
Betsy.

333
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,300
Mels.

334
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,460
Came by yourself?
We usually travel in pairs.

335
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,100
It's easier to fight off
squares that way.

336
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,740
Dryn.

337
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,060
Mels.

338
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,100
Mels.

339
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,060
Mel.

340
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,460
Mel.

341
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,660
All booked out!

342
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,420
We've paid already. We paid.

343
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,580
Easy, people. Advance reservation.

344
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,460
They're with us. We paid.

345
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,180
Booked out! All booked out.

346
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,660
She's with us too.

347
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,740
Why are you always late?

348
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,220
Let's go twist the atomic.

349
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,940
Are you always so pushy?

350
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,460
I'm not pushy.

351
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm determined.

352
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,980
And I'm not a prize cup to be won.

353
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,540
What should I do?

354
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,180
<i>Hey, stilyagi, hello!
We are hang out on Broadway.</i>

355
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,380
<i>Leaving the boring squares behind.</i>

356
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,460
<i>From me you've learned about
jazz and freedom.</i>

357
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,380
<i>I'm the one who tied a stylish tie
on your chest.</i>

358
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,820
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

359
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,820
<i>You stay with me.</i>

360
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,180
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

361
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,180
<i>I'm your playboy.</i>

362
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,620
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

363
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,460
<i>Don't you leave me.</i>

364
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,020
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

365
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,100
<i>My sky lark!</i>

366
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,020
<i>Hey, stilyagi, follow me
Through the forbidden doors!</i>

367
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,940
<i>If they catch us,
I'll solve the problem.</i>

368
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,100
<i>If you don't have a place
to check your feelings with a gal,</i>

369
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,860
<i>For my friend I will lend the keys to a room.</i>

370
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,220
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

371
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,140
<i>Stay with me!</i>

372
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,020
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

373
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,660
<i>I'm your playboy.</i>

374
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,300
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

375
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,780
<i>Don't you leave me.</i>

376
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,460
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

377
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,260
<i>My sky lark!</i>

378
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,460
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

379
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,740
<i>Oh, my little babe,</i>

380
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,900
<i>My sky lark!</i>

381
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,060
Calm down, dudes. Calm down.
We're on Broadway.

382
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,060
Mel, your people.

383
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,780
Hello, guys.

384
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,020
Good evening, Katya.

385
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,900
What does it all mean, Mels?

386
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,820
Nothing.

387
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,660
Hello, commissar, it's me!

388
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,580
Only the costume is different.

389
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,540
You wear one.

390
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,620
And I have a different one.

391
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,940
Just a different one, Katya.

392
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,220
You're worse than an enemy, Mels.

393
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,540
You are a traitor.

394
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,460
Katya, don't start that...
Katya...

395
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,900
- Let's go.
- Katya!

396
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,580
At ease, guys.

397
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,060
Feuf, problem is solved
even without calling my dad...

398
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,900
Hey, dude, do you know where
I can buy a sax?

399
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,140
Maybe you're also interested
in a machine gun?

400
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,180
Interested in a sax?

401
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,580
I am.

402
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,900
If you don't get a deal,
I'm not at fault.

403
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,540
There's a stilyaga.
He's looking for a saxophone.

404
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,500
- Hello.
- Good day.

405
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,380
How old are you, young man?

406
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,140
And you still don't know
what an amazing country we live in?

407
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,540
A bayan is allowed, an accordion is not.

408
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,060
The clarinet
is a politically correct instrument.

409
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,820
But the saxophone
is equated to a real weapon.

410
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,020
Come back in 10 years time...

411
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,700
When jazz will be played
in kindergartens.

412
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,060
And then we'll talk.

413
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,060
Listen, I understood you.
But I need it now.

414
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,260
I have the money with me.

415
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,500
<i>Mamba and twist,
jimmy, foxtrot and tango...</i>

416
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,660
<i>I have played them all many times in my life.</i>

417
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,060
<i>I'm a very high ranking captain...</i>

418
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,700
<i>On the rotting boat having the name of Jazz.</i>

419
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,300
<i>In this country, it would've been better for this boat to be a submarine.</i>

420
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,900
<i>Better to be a submarine!</i>

421
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,180
<i>In this country, doors are closed to Jazz.</i>

422
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,700
<i>Doors are closed to Jazz!</i>

423
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,740
<i>I filled the holds of my boat
with wine and vodka.</i>

424
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,380
<i>Vodka!</i>

425
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,340
<i>But I could never change course.</i>

426
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:54,900
<i>But I know what this pleasure feels like!
Melody, rhythm, and drive!</i>

427
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:01,020
<i>When you and your sax become one.</i>

428
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,300
<i>But if you want to learn all this...</i>

429
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,500
<i>And play this music too...</i>

430
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,420
<i>Then play, don't be afraid of anything!
You won't drown!</i>

431
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,820
NEW YORK, BERLIN, VARSHAVA...

432
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,220
Yeah, baby!

433
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,940
Yes, aha, very nice!

434
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,740
Kim.

435
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,940
Kim!

436
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,220
What happened?

437
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,860
Everyone else has normal brothers,
but mine is a stilyaga.

438
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:29,260
FRED'S PAD

439
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,300
- Good day!
- Hello!

440
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,500
- Such a nice weather!
- It's wonderful!

441
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,780
I wish it'd stay like this for a few days...

442
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,180
Fedya, the food is in the fridge.

443
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,420
I cooked for you
your favorite cutlets.

444
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,900
A salad as well. The shirts for the university are in the wardrobe, clean and ironed.

445
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,780
Study hard. You have exams soon. In particular practice your English.

446
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,340
Okay, Mom.

447
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,220
My poor baby.

448
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,780
Fedya, when you are practicing your English...

449
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,100
Please, try not to be as loud as you were last time. Understand?   - Ok.

450
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,540
Thank you. Farewell.

451
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,740
Girls, keep dancing! You see...

452
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,980
O, Mel!

453
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,020
O, Mel! How are you? (speaking English)

454
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,300
What?

455
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,860
Ok. I'll catch up with you.

456
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,060
So, look here, Mel...

457
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,740
The girls that interest us can be broken down into several categories.

458
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,500
First, there are the real chicks.

459
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,140
There's few of them.

460
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,620
Among the "chicks"
there are the "boruhi."

461
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,340
That's the ones that
do "borayutsya" with our guys.

462
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,660
I hope you understand what
I'm talking about.

463
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,540
Those are fewer still.

464
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,220
Want some?

465
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,140
- There're also the "pink-cheeked loafs."
- "Loafs"?

466
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,420
Yeah.

467
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,700
Their mom doesn't allow them to dress stylish, but they really want to try it all. Got it?   - Yes.

468
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,020
There are also the "squares."

469
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,140
- I know them.
- Great.

470
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,700
Well, there are also the..."rubtsi", "mochalki", "dinamistki"...

471
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,420
Which one is Polly?

472
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,340
Polly is Polly.

473
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,540
That's all. Learn the rest yourself.

474
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,860
Duke Ellington. Mandibular dislocation...

475
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,740
This usually happens,
when a patient yawns too wide...

476
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,100
or takes a big bite out of an apple.

477
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,500
Excuse me.

478
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,860
Come here.

479
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,780
Come here.

480
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,220
Beautiful, isn't it?

481
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,140
I was walking around here...

482
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,580
I was looking for you...

483
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,500
Why?

484
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,300
There is something I need to tell you.

485
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,700
I love you.

486
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,900
And it's serious.

487
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,380
Very much so...

488
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,660
Alright.

489
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,620
I want to kiss you.

490
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,420
Alright.

491
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,860
- Hold on.
- What?

492
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,620
- I need to see Sir John.
- What?

493
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,020
I need to go use the restroom.

494
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,620
I'll be right back.

495
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,820
<i>Sleep sound at night, Mama,
We are rooting for Dynamo!</i>

496
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,900
Don't be upset so...

497
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,700
Fred, does she have someone?

498
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,780
My advice to you: if it's only for fun,
then find something easier.

499
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,180
It's not just for fun.

500
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,620
Look...

501
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,980
Every one of them... and a 100 more will tell you that they've slept with her...

502
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,700
And every single one of them
will be lying.

503
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,140
Everyone tried,
and everyone... got nothing.

504
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,900
What about you?

505
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,860
I'm a lost cause in all this.

506
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,700
Because my daddy is a diplomat and because I'm studying at MGIMO (diplomacy school).

507
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,700
Because I have a car and this apartment.

508
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,940
But she...

509
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,700
She's Polly.

510
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,100
She always does everything
the other way around.

511
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,420
Listen...

512
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,540
Have you ever... been with a girl?

513
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,220
So, you get a girl in bed with you.

514
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,100
And what's next?

515
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,660
What's so difficult?

516
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,780
Ignorance!

517
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,540
Why do I have to teach you all?

518
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,180
Here. Take this and read it.

519
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,500
Maybe it will be of some use.

520
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,460
But open this only at home, behind a door of three locks. In an emergency, eat it.

521
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,820
The same way a spy eats and destroys his secret addresses. Understand?

522
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,020
(Knock on the door)

523
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,620
Are you alive in there?

524
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,140
Everybody wants to go.
Get out!

525
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,660
Go, go, go!

526
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,940
<i>I see...</i>

527
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,940
<i>I see your eyes once again...</i>

528
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,980
<i>They are a reflection...</i>

529
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,500
<i>Of my love.</i>

530
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,220
<i>The whole world...</i>

531
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,980
<i>I have jokingly turned into you.</i>

532
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:11,660
<i>Everywhere I see you.</i>

533
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,460
<i>Let everything be exactly as you wish,</i>

534
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,860
<i>Let your eyes shine
as bright as they did before,</i>

535
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,380
<i>I'm with you once again tonight,</i>

536
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:29,540
<i>Actually... tomorrow night,</i>

537
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,900
<i>If you so desire,</i>

538
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,580
<i>I'll be with you again.</i>

539
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,340
<i>To me it doesn't matter</i>

540
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,260
<i>What day or what time it is.</i>

541
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,740
<i>Time has stopped,</i>

542
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,100
<i>And there is only the sky and
the light in your eyes.</i>

543
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,060
<i>I'm free and happy,</i>

544
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,540
<i>And this song is about how...</i>

545
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,260
<i>We knew life to be so wonderful.</i>

546
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,740
<i>Believe me for the moment,
you'll understand it later.</i>

547
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:10,300
<i>Let everything be exactly as you wish,</i>

548
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,660
<i>Let your eyes shine
as bright as they did before,</i>

549
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,500
<i>I'm with you once again tonight,</i>

550
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:22,420
<i>Actually... tomorrow night,</i>

551
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,220
<i>If you so desire,</i>

552
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,580
<i>I'll be with you again.</i>

553
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,700
<i>My friends and brothers!</i>

554
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,460
<i>I will share my happiness with you.</i>

555
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,860
<i>There will be enough for everyone today.</i>

556
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,340
<i>I know that for sure and
I'm not afraid.</i>

557
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,660
<i>I hope that on this stage one day...</i>

558
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,900
<i>just as I'm speaking today...</i>

559
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,140
<i>these words will be repeated
by everyone single one of you out there...</i>

560
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,580
<i>these words about love!</i>

561
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,980
<i>Let everything be exactly as you wish,</i>

562
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,140
<i>Let your eyes shine as bright
as they did before,</i>

563
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:21,140
<i>I'm with you once again tonight,</i>

564
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:26,020
<i>Actually... tomorrow night,</i>

565
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,820
<i>Tomorrow night!</i>

566
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:32,380
<i>If you so desire,
I'll be with you again.</i>

567
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,860
Train, guys!

568
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,100
Let's go!

569
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,940
Come on! Quick! Quick!

570
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,460
Don't turn on the music,
don't use the bathroom.

571
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:55,220
THE PAD, THE KEY TO WHICH MELS
GOT FROM NOLIK.

572
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,180
<i>The mascara is smudged,
the clothes are crumpled,</i>

573
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,260
<i>Forgotten are school, mom,
and shame.</i>

574
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,300
<i>And a run is coming down
my nylon stocking.</i>

575
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,220
<i>Every prohibition just makes me laugh.</i>

576
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,220
<i>I care not about all those rules.</i>

577
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,980
<i>And only you can I show
how I really am.</i>

578
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,700
<i>The badges pinned on to
the grey jackets,</i>

579
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,580
<i>In people's faces only boredom or fear.</i>

580
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:21,340
<i>I used to be like everybody else
before I met you.</i>

581
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:25,060
<i>But life will change now,</i>

582
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:28,860
<i>We'll walk out this door together,</i>

583
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:35,300
<i>And we'll be together no matter
what the cost.</i>

584
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:03,660
<i>The ticking of the clock,
the neighbors behind the wall...</i>

585
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:10,060
<i>The world will never be the same.</i>

586
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:17,900
<i>It will be all different
because you're with me.</i>

587
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:25,860
<i>We need each other like the air and water.</i>

588
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,060
Hello, Mels.

589
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,420
Hi, Commissar.

590
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,500
I actually have a name.
Did you forget?

591
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,180
Hello, Katya!

592
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,900
How will it be in your language?

593
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,260
Katy?

594
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,660
It's just too scary to think about...
Are you waiting for somebody?

595
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:33,980
For you.

596
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,980
Can I ask you something
as an old friend?

597
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:41,540
Our record player at home broke down,
and you are the best at these sorts of things.

598
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,340
How will it be in your language...?

599
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,500
Always ready!

600
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:52,940
Look at this stilyaga! He should be locked up in a cage to scare children with.

601
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,060
Aren't you disgusted to be walking next to someone like that? You are a girl after all!

602
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,060
Maybe you better take off
your Komsomol badge!

603
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:05,940
Don't torture yourself, Katya. Let's walk on different sides of the street and meet up in front of your place?

604
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,380
No, it's fine.

605
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,060
I just want to know, what do you feel when people look at you that way?

606
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:13,980
I like it!

607
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,020
It's fun!

608
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,620
You'll fall!

609
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,900
It's great, Katya, when all people
are different.

610
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:25,500
I'm like this. She's like that.
And you are completely different.

611
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,220
Get down this instant!

612
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,420
Are you able to just walk normally?

613
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,980
- I don't want to be different.
- Why?

614
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,860
Because I don't think I'm better
than other people.

615
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:46,940
It's not about being better or worse, but just different! Do you understand?

616
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,980
Katya! Do you have a thin screwdriver?

617
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,860
I'll take a look...

618
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,180
Like this?

619
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,740
You are so beautiful, Katya.

620
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,060
It's my mom's.

621
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,860
Do you like it?

622
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,300
I do.

623
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,980
Now you are beginning to look
like a human being.

624
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,100
Thank you.

625
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,780
C'mon, don't take offense!

626
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,980
Look...

627
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,780
Look, how beautiful you are!

628
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,940
Look.

629
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,940
Do you see?

630
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,900
So much has happened!

631
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:56,740
Can you imagine? Semyon took down an armed criminal, one on one, at the train station.

632
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:01,140
He had a knife, and Semyon grabbed the blade with his bare hands!

633
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,220
Now he is wearing a cast on his hand.
They even wrote about him in the newspapers!

634
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,420
And I thought you guys
have only us to chase after.

635
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:07,700
Oh, stop it!

636
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,700
Ivan got married.

637
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:16,180
To Lyuba. You know her. She's big... She's the one who did the shot put at the sports competitions.

638
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,460
Do you remember?

639
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,660
- Is this interesting for you?
- Sure.

640
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,700
Let's drink some more.

641
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,740
Alright.

642
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,140
To what?

643
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,540
To you!

644
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,740
Do you want me to put
on some music?

645
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,580
You mean this... "Boogie Bones" of yours?

646
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,500
Yes.

647
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,580
I want it!

648
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:17,380
Katya, what are you doing?

649
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:19,460
Katya!

650
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,660
Katya, what are you doing?
What if your parents come in?

651
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,380
They won't come.
I sent them go to the theater.

652
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,860
Katya, have you lost your mind?

653
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,580
That's all that you want from her.
Am I any worse?

654
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,740
So you have decided to rescue me?
I don't need to be rescued.

655
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,420
I'm doing just fine.

656
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:37,060
But you told me yourself that
I'm very beautiful.

657
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,780
You are very beautiful, Katya.

658
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,980
But I love her. Do you understand?

659
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,420
Who?

660
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,580
That swine?

661
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,460
That prostitute?

662
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,300
You don't even know her.

663
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,300
Last thing I need
is to get to know her!

664
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,340
That's all, Katya. I'm leaving.

665
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,500
I'm sorry, Katya.

666
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,180
Get out! Get out!

667
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,100
I'm sorry, Katya.

668
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,460
Get out!

669
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,060
I'm leaving.

670
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,420
Get out!

671
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,620
Get out!

672
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,740
Stop torturing the poor animal!

673
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:45,620
Come to my office.

674
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,100
Coming.

675
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:54,060
Fedor, do I call you every time before returning home from the summer villa?

676
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:59,140
Do you have enough time to
clean up around here?

677
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,540
Yes.

678
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,300
The explain please why in my own office...

679
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,420
I find this "body armor"?

680
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,980
Betsy... I'm sorry, dad!

681
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:24,420
I understand that one can leave behind a hairpin, a scarf... even virginity...

682
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,620
But how can someone leave without their bra - that I cannot understand.

683
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:35,860
Understand, Fedor.
One day your mom will find this.

684
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:40,940
And then I will have all the problems.
I and not you!

685
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,300
- Understand?
- Okay.

686
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,940
I'll be checking everyone
myself personally upon exit.

687
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,500
Hold on. I need to talk to you.
Sit down.

688
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,940
- Did you take any?
- No!

689
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,220
I'll kill you.

690
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,580
Now let's talk serious.

691
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,500
Put that thing away!

692
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:20,340
Fedor, I spoke to the Deputy Secretary yesterday...
I'll do my best to persuade him...

693
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,380
- to send you to the States for an internship...
- Where? To America?

694
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:26,700
Hold on.

695
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,540
I want for you to understand that this is not going to be a pleasure trip.

696
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,380
This is the first step in your career.

697
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:45,060
If everything goes well, you'll come back, finish university. Then go there for a permanent job as an assistant to Third Secretary of Embassy.

698
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,780
Do you agree?

699
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,260
No questions, dad!

700
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,220
- I asked you! Yes or no?
- Yes.

701
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:55,780
And you are ready to do everything
necessary to make it happen?

702
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,100
Of course.

703
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,820
Okay.

704
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,140
There are 3 conditions.

705
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:09,020
Tomorrow you take off this clown costume and change into normal Soviet clothes.

706
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,500
Then you go to the hair salon
and change your wonderful "kok"...

707
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:17,300
to an ideologically correct business cut.

708
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,180
Second.

709
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,700
Tomorrow you will see your friends
for the very last time.

710
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,940
Sorry for the cynicism,
but there are certain rules.

711
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:55,260
Either you accept those rules or
you go work at the factory.

712
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:00,380
At your age
I also used to dance in pubs.

713
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:09,820
And, believe me, that your silly meandering back and forth on Broadway...

714
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,140
is a poorly made parody on what
we had going on!

715
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:26,980
Childhood diseases need to be had and
overcome in childhood.

716
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,140
And third?

717
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,700
Attention, recording.

718
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:42,580
Nothing serious. You must marry.

719
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,980
Parting with the chicks. Take 1.

720
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,540
To whom?

721
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,380
Girls, get ready.

722
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:50,940
If only to Betsy...

723
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,300
What Betsy? Are you crazy?
Betsy!

724
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,340
Fire in your eyes.
Pull in your stomachs and bottoms...

725
01:21:56,580 --> 01:22:01,940
Marry the daughter of academic Kupriyanov.

726
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:06,140
She likes you from childhood.

727
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:10,100
Most important:
the feelings, the emotions.

728
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:13,100
Your mom and I are living together
quite well, right?

729
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:32,260
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

730
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:36,540
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

731
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,020
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

732
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:45,300
<i>My sweetheart! You're leaving? Goodbye!</i>

733
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,740
<i>I had loved you so selflessly.</i>

734
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:53,980
<i>You showed me a new world,
a new Paradise,</i>

735
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:58,460
<i>But now you are leaving it
so inconspicuously.</i>

736
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,700
<i>You're going to be an ordinary
Soviet diplomat,</i>

737
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:07,020
<i>As if you have forgotten everything
about your past.</i>

738
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:11,900
<i>But we continue waiting for you, brother.</i>

739
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:16,060
<i>In your heart you are still a stilyaga,
just as before.</i>

740
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,860
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

741
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,540
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

742
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,980
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

743
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:33,180
<i>Let the expensive shoes
be tossed to the side,</i>

744
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:37,780
<i>Let your hair no longer sparkle
with grease,</i>

745
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:42,060
<i>But I will not shed a single tear.</i>

746
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:46,620
<i>Goodbye, my dear!
The man I loved!</i>

747
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:50,900
<i>Your choice is clear.
Go on, dude!</i>

748
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:55,500
<i>Follow your father onto
the big highway.</i>

749
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:59,460
<i>It's a pity that you're leaving like this,</i>

750
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:04,180
<i>I'm sorry, but we're different,
quite different.</i>

751
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:08,260
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

752
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:12,420
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

753
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:16,740
<i>He does not need an American wife!</i>

754
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:21,300
<i>You'll be able to get a lot in return</i>

755
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:26,020
<i>From the generous gal
that is called Life.</i>

756
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,180
<i>But never again will you be free,</i>

757
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:34,660
<i>And the stylish youth will
hardly ever return.</i>

758
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,100
Let's begin, comrades.

759
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,260
Sit down, comrades,
we are starting.

760
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:54,540
On today's agenda we have the case of
Komsomol member Mels Biryukov.

761
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,300
Mels, stand up!

762
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,500
He used to be the Soviet student Mels.

763
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:13,380
Now we see before us...
the stilyaga Mel!

764
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:19,580
It seems like no big deal,
just one letter difference, right?

765
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,340
But let us remember.

766
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,940
What is the meaning of
the name "Mels"?

767
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:28,820
It is the abbreviation of names
that are sacred to us.

768
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:30,900
Marks...

769
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,020
Engels...

770
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,620
Lenin...

771
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,580
Stalin...

772
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,940
Now let's stop and think...

773
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:48,060
What is the meaning behind
the carelessly discarded letter "S"?

774
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,060
<i>He lived among us,</i>

775
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,900
<i>We marched in one column.</i>

776
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,420
<i>He was an honest guy,</i>

777
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,060
<i>He was a simple hero.</i>

778
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:17,100
<i>But the truth cannot be hidden for long,
The hour has come.</i>

779
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,460
<i>And now his animal grin
has been exposed.</i>

780
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,340
<i>And now his animal grin
has been exposed.</i>

781
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,900
<i>Chained by one chain,</i>

782
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,740
<i>Connected by one aim.</i>

783
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:33,700
<i>Chained by one chain,</i>

784
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,620
<i>Connected by one aim.</i>

785
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:40,220
<i>You have dared to encroach on our
sacred sanctum,</i>

786
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,940
<i>Where are your ideals?</i>

787
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,700
<i>You've spit on them!</i>

788
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:47,340
<i>You sold yourself to the enemy
for bright clothes,</i>

789
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:50,300
<i>You easily deserted your conscience
and honor.</i>

790
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,460
<i>But you will not win,
our chain will never be broken!</i>

791
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,620
<i>Chained by one chain,</i>

792
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,380
<i>Connected by one aim.</i>

793
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:03,540
<i>Chained by one chain,</i>

794
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:07,180
<i>Connected by one aim.</i>

795
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:36,220
<i>Don't you dare dance to
the fat cat's music!</i>

796
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:40,060
<i>Don't you dare
to clown and betray us!</i>

797
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,220
<i>Such a person as you should not
be near us,</i>

798
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,420
<i>When we are marching as one.</i>

799
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,660
<i>Our Party is our mother, Komsomol is our father!</i>

800
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,500
<i>Hey, you there, stand still!</i>

801
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,300
<i>Nice! Good fellow!</i>

802
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,580
<i>We will not sing to a foreign tune!</i>

803
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,940
<i>Our joyful bugle will awake us!</i>

804
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:03,180
<i>Chained by one chain,</i>

805
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:06,460
<i>Connected by one aim.</i>

806
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,420
<i>Chained by one chain,</i>

807
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:12,220
<i>Connected by one aim.</i>

808
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:16,420
<i>There is no place here
for such rascals and vermins,</i>

809
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:19,860
<i>Here our own ideals
will be left to descendants.</i>

810
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,220
<i>Here our chorus
will sing, rowing down the stream,</i>

811
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:26,540
<i>Here we march together,
keeping our unity,</i>

812
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,860
<i>We will enjoy going
forward without you!</i>

813
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:33,220
<i>Chained by one chain,</i>

814
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:36,940
<i>Connected by one aim.</i>

815
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:29,940
Are you going somewhere?

816
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,740
I have a bad news, Mel.

817
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,740
Me too.

818
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,620
I have really bad news.

819
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,420
And I have really bad ones too.
What are yours?

820
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,740
I'm leaving,
and we are breaking up.

821
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:42,580
What's your news?

822
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,140
Then I have...

823
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,220
just minor difficulties.

824
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,380
Polina, what's wrong?

825
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:01,660
Why are you silent?

826
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,260
You don't have the right
to decide this all by yourself!

827
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,300
You can't decide this
for both of us!

828
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:09,260
You even can't decide this
for yourself!

829
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:11,380
I'm pregnant, Mel!

830
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,020
But that's great, Polly.

831
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,620
So we will have a baby.

832
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:33,100
It's not your baby, Mel.

833
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:44,900
It's my baby.

834
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,060
Mine.

835
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:54,820
It's my baby!

836
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,020
Also, my mom kicked me out
from the home.

837
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,420
Well...

838
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,540
It [marriage] is a good thing.

839
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,340
Maybe now you will finally
calm down.

840
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,860
As they say in science...

841
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:09,740
Multiply a negative by a negative,
and there you have a strong family unit.

842
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,180
So why are you standing
thunderstruck?

843
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:16,620
Did you hear?

844
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,540
You are going to have
a nephew soon.

845
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:21,860
Go. Get the beds ready.

846
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,060
It's so strange...

847
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:39,060
that we don't need to hide anymore.

848
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,100
Polly...

849
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,620
What?

850
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,220
What do you think?

851
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:01,860
Will we hurt him?

852
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,140
If we...

853
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:11,380
I don't know.

854
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,820
Right now he is still
very little.

855
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:58,220
Come on. Come on.

856
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:01,180
Quick-quick-quick!

857
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,380
Come on, go, dear.

858
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:41,460
"A Challenge to Soviet Ideology"

859
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,660
"Today You Are Playing Jazz,
Tomorrow You Sell Your Motherland!"

860
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,300
"Playing To A Foreign Tune"

861
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,420
"Monkeys Are Among Us"

862
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,540
"Jazz Is Not Our Music"

863
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,740
"An Embarrassment To Our Youth"

864
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:31,180
It is a constant. A constant is invariable.
Because usually...

865
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,340
I felt faint.

866
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:01,860
Let's go get fresh air.

867
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,660
No. It's ok.

868
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,740
Soon I won't be able to
dance at all.

869
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,580
Let's go sign the papers
tomorrow?

870
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:18,740
Let's wait with the marriage.

871
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,460
Why wait?

872
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,740
Let the baby be born first.

873
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:38,300
Raid!!!

874
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:18,780
Mels!

875
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:26,740
Katya...

876
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,740
Are you serious?

877
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,580
Katya, that's enough.
Let her go.

878
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:42,660
Katya! I'm really asking you!
Katya!

879
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,740
Don't touch her! Beasts!

880
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:56,580
You're doing so well!
Should I get a perm too?

881
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:58,860
I was just planning to cut
my hair today.

882
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:03,580
But there are queues everywhere. Leave me you number, once it grows out, I'll come again.

883
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:09,100
By the way, how much does it cost? I'm afraid I may not have the right sum on me.

884
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:13,220
Miss, can you make it a bit shorter yet?

885
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:16,500
Just a bit shorter?

886
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:19,780
Once my hair grows out, I'll come
see you again.

887
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:25,060
Miss, where are you going, Miss?

888
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,460
Miss, you forgot your tip.

889
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:58,420
JOHN WAS BORN HERE

890
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:43,500
Pour some to everyone!

891
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:48,300
Pour to everybody! Come on! Pour!

892
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,220
Everyone drinks!

893
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:58,820
Polina! Polina!

894
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:01,900
Show us the boy!

895
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:05,060
What are you standing around for, daddy?
Go meet'em!

896
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:08,820
Polina, show us the boy!

897
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:25,700
Hands off! Grandfather first...

898
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,660
Who does he look like?

899
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:42,180
Who?

900
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,140
Oh, my God!

901
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,540
Ours.

902
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:05,580
Ours.

903
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:10,100
Ours!

904
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:12,020
Ours.

905
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,380
A warrior!

906
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,380
Our warrior!

907
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,500
His name was Michel.

908
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,980
One of ours?

909
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:16,980
No, he was an American.

910
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:30,260
He was walking down Sadovaya Street, trying to talk to somebody to get directions...

911
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:31,980
But people would all get scared
and run away.

912
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:33,460
Did you love him?

913
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,900
No. This was something
completely different.

914
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:43,100
He was like a man from
another planet...

915
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:45,140
And he was here for only
a couple of hours...

916
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:50,700
And there's so much you need to ask about them! So much to tell them about us...

917
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:56,660
But time is running out.
The flight back is so soon!

918
01:46:57,700 --> 01:47:00,340
And we both know that we will never
see each other again.

919
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:04,780
Is that what you wanted to hear?

920
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:08,420
Are you satisfied?

921
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:51,500
A way towards the reduction of
international tension...

922
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:54,940
Hello.

923
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:14,060
Well hello there, daughter.

924
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:20,660
Where are you going, louse? Where?!

925
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:26,580
You got what you wanted, you slut?
Got what you wanted, you American prostitute?

926
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,180
I've been fired from work everywhere!

927
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,100
I should have killed you!

928
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:32,300
Miss!

929
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,380
Miss! This is not the way!

930
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:37,140
Comrade!

931
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:40,700
Comrade.

932
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:43,100
Comrade?

933
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:46,260
I'm no comrade to you!

934
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:50,260
I'll put you all in prison!
I'll leave you all to rot in there!

935
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:57,780
Louses! Louses!
Swines! Spies!

936
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:05,460
Calm down, dear.

937
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:08,140
Calm down.

938
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:22,820
How did you name the baby?

939
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,380
Ivan.

940
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:30,380
Like her father.

941
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,460
Let me look at him at least.

942
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,540
He has our eyes after all.

943
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:17,500
What's this?
What are you feeding him?

944
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:23,100
What were you thinking? You have an apartment, but you are keeping him in this thoroughfare?

945
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:26,940
We have our own room here.
And the second one...

946
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,180
I know what you have here.

947
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:32,820
30 men use one bathroom, yeah?

948
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:36,700
Unsanitary conditions, typhus, tuberculosis, diarrhea, jaundice.

949
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,380
Let's go home.

950
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:45,180
Pack your stuff.

951
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:51,980
Who needs me now?

952
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,940
Mom, I need you.

953
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:21,260
Dudes!

954
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,740
Ivan.

955
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,500
No, he's John!

956
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:29,260
Where is Polly?

957
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,220
Did you hide her from the world?

958
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:34,580
You men are all the same. First you talk about love, then point to the baby crib.

959
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:38,020
Betty! Have your own baby first,
and then we'll see.

960
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:39,940
Oh, God! No thanks!
Knock on wood.

961
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,140
Du-ude!

962
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,340
Hi, Johnny!

963
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,340
Look, a "kok"!
He's already growing one!

964
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:03,260
A real stilyaga!
I don't know how to hold him.

965
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,540
I love you, baby.

966
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:20,100
Mom is here.

967
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:52,980
Listen... Wait around the corner.
I'll be there soon.

968
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:19,420
Fred...

969
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:21,500
Mel.

970
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:24,100
Fred.

971
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:25,460
Mel!

972
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:28,660
Fred!

973
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:29,860
Mel!

974
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,300
I asked you to be quiet!

975
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:35,340
Freddy.

976
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,500
Polly. Polly!

977
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:04,780
Polly.

978
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,580
- Be quiet!
- Got it.

979
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:08,420
This is for you and the baby.

980
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:13,060
By the way, the latest achievement of imperialism: the no-spill baby cup.

981
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:14,740
No matter how you turn it, it doesn't spill.

982
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:17,820
Don't talk to him about it. He don't even know how to prepare a baby bottle.

983
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:19,260
He's above all that!

984
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:27,300
You see, Fred. Polina thinks that to be in accordance with gender equality I too must feed the baby with my breast.

985
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:33,060
Hey, dudes...
Let's discuss this without me.

986
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:37,580
I flew to you across the ocean.
I have my own load of these problems back home.

987
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:42,860
Well, show me the baby.

988
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:45,820
He's awake already anyways.

989
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:51,940
How are you doing living with
the mother-in-law?

990
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,380
Do you get along?

991
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:55,300
In the morning it's lineup.

992
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:57,620
In the evening - roll call.

993
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:01,060
He misses living in a communal apartment.

994
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:03,180
He prefers waiting in line
to use the toilet.

995
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:10,060
That's him?

996
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:20,420
Listen Mel, I think you've been listening to too much of Charlie Parker.

997
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:47,260
<i>Among the slums and skyscrapers and many ads
Americans are walking and chewing bubble gum.</i>

998
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:55,500
<i>Robbing, killing, humming chu-chu,
And laying with stylish ladies.</i>

999
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,620
Dude!

1000
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:00,060
Hush! I asked you to be quiet!

1001
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,540
You know about Bob?

1002
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:20,620
Can your dad help him?

1003
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:22,700
No.

1004
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:25,860
Betsy was evicted from Moscow.

1005
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:28,100
I know.

1006
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:30,180
- And Dryn is in the army?
- Yes.

1007
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:34,940
He is crazy. He want to military office in the whole outfit.

1008
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:38,540
In his shoes, with that hair. So they sent him
to serve on a submarine for 5 years.

1009
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:42,620
Tell about America!

1010
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:45,060
About America...

1011
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:47,940
About America...

1012
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:54,180
This is the American style of dress.

1013
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:56,860
What style?
You look like a square.

1014
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:59,820
Why? Look at the quality!

1015
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,420
Feel it!

1016
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:04,540
See the label?

1017
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:08,260
It's more important what's on the inside.

1018
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,740
The more free a person is,
the more simple his dress.

1019
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:15,180
Mel...

1020
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:18,260
I have bad news for you.

1021
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:22,060
There are no stilyagas in America.

1022
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:24,940
What do you mean?

1023
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:28,220
It's just so. No stilyagas.

1024
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:35,420
If we walked down Broadway
dressed like this...

1025
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:37,420
down the real Broadway...

1026
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:40,500
we'd be taken to a nut house
after walking two blocks.

1027
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:44,820
Mel, try to understand.
There are no stilyagas there.

1028
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:49,980
- Get lost.
- Mel!

1029
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:52,620
- Get lost!
- Mel.

1030
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:54,020
Go to hell!

1031
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:03,300
But we exist.

1032
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:32,060
<i>Mister, please don't kick us out of
the building hallway.</i>

1033
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:39,300
<i>We will no longer sing loudly.</i>

1034
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:47,780
<i>We will no longer drink, cuss or smoke.</i>

1035
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:55,220
<i>And if you want to do these things yourself,
then don't invite us.</i>

1036
02:02:55,860 --> 02:03:00,300
<i>Today we are saying goodbye...</i>

1037
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:08,900
<i>I thought we had a reserve of
at least another 5 years.</i>

1038
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:16,700
<i>I was so sure that we had enough time to drink beer and chat.</i>

1039
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:24,660
<i>But I already see your back, as you are departing
with a sign saying "Don't miss me".</i>

1040
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:28,580
<i>Wait! Stay for at least one more day!</i>

1041
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:33,100
<i>Go on, play on!</i>

1042
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:35,580
<i>Goodbye, my dear friend.</i>

1043
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:40,820
<i>Go on, play on!</i>

1044
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:43,060
<i>You are leaving so suddenly.</i>

1045
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:47,580
<i>Go on, play on!</i>

1046
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:50,060
<i>You are leaving without
saying goodbye.</i>

1047
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:53,420
<i>You are leaving so unexpectedly.</i>

1048
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:57,500
<i>Well, goodbye, my dear friend.</i>

1049
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:01,740
<i>Go on, play on!</i>

1050
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:34,060
<i>You know, it's all really not so bad.</i>

1051
02:04:34,380 --> 02:04:37,340
<i>This style defeats fear.</i>

1052
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:40,980
<i>This amazing, difficult, absurd epoch...</i>

1053
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:44,260
<i>Did not turn us into dust.</i>

1054
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:47,700
<i>Let us remember all these faces...</i>

1055
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:51,340
<i>And the sharp edge of a vinyl disk.</i>

1056
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:56,340
<i>And may Love save us all!</i>

1057
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:00,060
<i>Go on, play on!</i>

1058
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:02,380
