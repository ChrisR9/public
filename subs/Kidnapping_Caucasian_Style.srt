It was Shurik
who toId us this story.

20
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
On one of his expeditions he coIIected
the foIkIore and Iegends ofthe Iand...

21
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This story may, in fact, be onIy
a Iegend, too,

22
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but Shurik insists it reaIIy did occur
in one of mountainous regions.

23
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He didn't specify which region it was,
because he wanted to be fair

24
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:57,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to aII the other regions where such
story might have happened.

25
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on!

26
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you going?

27
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Damn it!

28
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What made me agree to drive this
oId asthmatic vacuum cIeaner?

29
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,467  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't Iose hope!

30
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I remember what the great and wise
Abou-Akhmat-ibn-Bey said,

31
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who was the first driver of
that machine. He said: ''Edik...''

32
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Edik.
- Shurik.

33
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So he said to me, ''Edik,
onIy AIIah himseIf knows

34
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
where goes the spark
ofthis degenerate

35
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in the famiIy of internaI-combustion
engines.''

36
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
May its carburetor
go dead forever!

37
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Pardon me...
- Yes?

38
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,782  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me...

39
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- WouId you mind...
- Yes?

40
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
WiII you pIease not zig zag,
and stay on the road?

41
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Why?
- My donkey's foIIowing you.

42
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:09,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- So it's your donkey who pursued me?
- That's right.

43
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And I had the impression...
- No, it's him!

44
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Are you from around here?
- Yes, I'm here on vacation.

45
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'm here on business. How far is
the town? - 2 kiIometers.

46
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,780  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Thanks very much. Goodbye now.
- Have a nice time.

47
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on...
Move!

48
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You see, he won't budge
unIess you go first.

49
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Year of birth?
- 1942.

50
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Purpose ofyour visit?
- EthnoIogicaI research.

51
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I see... Looking for oiI?
- No. I'm Iooking for foIkIore.

52
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm making records ofyour
oId taIes, Iegends, toasts.

53
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Toasts?!

54
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My dear man, you're in Iuck...
I can heIp you.

55
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
CIosed for Iunch

56
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's this?

57
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You want a good toast?
- Yes.

58
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A toast without wine is the same as
a wedding without a bride.

59
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- No, I don't drink.
- Who drinks?

60
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This isn't drinking.

61
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You didn't understand.
I don't drink at aII.

62
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You see, I'm not physicaIIy
abIe to.

63
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This wiII make
my first toast.

64
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- A toast? I'II copy it.
- You'II do it Iater. Take this gIass.

65
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My great grandfather aIways said:

66
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:45,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''I desire to buy a house, but I don't
have the means to do it.

67
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have the means to purchase a goat,
but I don't desire it.''

68
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So Iet us drink to
our desires

69
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,374  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
aIways meeting
our possibiIities.

70
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Good for you.
- Right...

71
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Now, here's another toast.
- Right...

72
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'II be right back.
- Take your time. I'II breathe a bit.

73
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II get some fresh air, a break from
sitting in my office aII the time.

74
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
AIways the office...

75
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Where have you been?
- Something wrong?

76
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- My niece.
- A pIeasure to meet you.

77
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina.

78
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- She's studying to be a teacher.
- Teaching those who'II take our pIace.

79
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ExceIIent student, KomsomoI member,
athIetic girI.

80
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- AthIetic?
- UncIe knows everything about me.

81
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You're just what we need.
- And what do you need?

82
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me ask you a question,
a question you'd probabIy not expect.

83
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go ahead.

84
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,727  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What do you think of marriage?
- I think of it positiveIy.

85
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's too young to think about it.

86
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:25,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's never too earIy, and never too
Iate. Go get the car started.

87
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's your opinion about our
inauguration of a new Wedding PaIace?

88
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'II be there for sure.
- WiII you?

89
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,905  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I may ask you for a favor,
a smaII one, but important.

90
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What is it?
- I'II teII you Iater. See you there.

91
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
AII right.

92
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:54,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And when the whoIe fIock
migrated to the south,

93
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
one smaII but proud bird said:

94
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''As for me, I shaII head up
to the sun.''

95
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And he started upward,
he fIew upward, upward,

96
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but soon the heat ofthe sun
burnt his wings,

97
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:17,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and he dropped down to the bottom
of a very deep canyon.

98
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So my toast is
that no one of us,

99
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
no matter how high you get,

100
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ever fIy too far
from the rest ofthe coIIective.

101
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong?

102
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So sorry for the bird!

103
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The princess was so angered
that she hanged herseIf,

104
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
because he had counted the exact
totaI of grains in the sack,

105
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the exact sum of drops in the sea,
and the totaI of stars gIeaming.

106
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So I propose a toast to cybernetics!

107
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have one, pIease.

108
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For you!

109
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wedding PaIace

110
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dear friends!

111
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Today is a great and joyous day...

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a beautifuI day.

113
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:41,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In just a few seconds,
these siIver shears

114
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
wiII cut this red
siIken ribbon

115
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and, thus, open to aII the newIyweds
of our region

116
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the road to the radiant future,

117
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:59,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the road to happiness, to Iove, to
accord, through our Wedding PaIace.

118
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To inaugurate the paIace then...

119
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
we agreed among ourseIves...

120
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that the honor of inaugurating
our paIace

121
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
wouId be conferred upon
a fine girI

122
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who represents...

123
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,545  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a new generation of mountainous
women.

124
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:34,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She is a student...
a KomsomoI member... an athIete...

125
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And with aII this,
she's just a beauty.

126
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You see what I meant by a smaII,
but important favor. WouId you...

127
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
PIease.

128
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And to quote our wonderfuI satirist,
Arkady Raikin,

129
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a woman is a friend of man.

130
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just a minute...
Just one minute...

131
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,262  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
WouId you speak a bit more sIowIy.
I'm taking this down.

132
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who is he?

133
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Must be a reporter.
- Ah, a reporter!

134
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:31,608  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
AII right, to quote Arkady Raikin,
a woman is a friend of man.

135
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hooray for you!
We must drink a toast to girIs...

136
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:41,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give that back! Give me back
my horn, I teII you!

137
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's my horn!

138
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was the cause ofthe faiIure of
the Wedding PaIace ceremony.

139
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then, upon the ruins ofthe chapeI...

140
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me...
Did I destroy the chapeI too?

141
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, that was done in the 14th century.

142
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As I was saying, upon the ruins of
the chapeI...

143
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is aII quite right.
Yes, it's aII exact.

144
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything is put down correctIy.
It's perfect, very good.

145
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But it's onIy one side ofthe case.
And what's the other side?

146
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This feIon is not a feIon,
he's a great man of science,

147
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:27,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he's an inteIIectuaI.
He has come to visit us.

148
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's gathering stories...
Iegends, you know... toasts.

149
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Toasts?
- Yes, toasts.

150
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I guess he overestimated
his potentiaI, right?

151
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What we have here
is an on-the-job accident.

152
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've got
a magnificent toast.

153
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
HoteI

154
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You have a very wrong idea
about our region.

155
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everybody knows the Kuzbass is...

156
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kuzbass is the forge
ofthe Soviet Union, right?

157
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kuban is our granary...

158
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And Caucasus is... what?
- Our sanatorium!

159
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sanatorium?
No!

160
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Caucasus is the forge, the granary
and the sanatorium ofthe Soviet Union.

161
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My dear friend, where did you
disappear?

162
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Last night I remembered a splendid
old toast. Come aIong.

163
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait. I must speak to Shurik.
Why don't you put down your toast,

164
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and make three copies of it,
and present it in writing.

165
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II do it!

166
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's my dream to record
some ancient ceremony.

167
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It wouId be great
if I couId take part in it.

168
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, where can we find it...
Look around at what's going on.

169
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,421  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, in our region, the old ways
and traditions are dead.

170
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Perhaps high up in the mountains,
you might find something

171
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for your science,
but not down here.

172
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Then I'll go up there.
- Right. It's your job, isn't it?

173
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,737  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've come here
to record fairy taIes,

174
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and we are working here
to make fairy tales real.

175
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes?

176
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've brought the toast.

177
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
FeeIing bad, eh?

178
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who gave you permission?
- You toId me to bring three copies.

179
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Life is grand, isn't it?

180
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And the grand Iife is even better!
- You're right!

181
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Administrator of RegionaI Economy
B.G. Saakhov

182
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aren't you ashamed ofyourseIf?
You'd cheat a poor orphan?

183
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She got nobody but her uncIe and aunt.
Twenty five.

184
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I respect your niece,
but there're Iimits to everything.

185
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Eighteen.
- Have you got no shame?

186
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:55,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After aII, you're getting not a goat,
but a wife, and what a wife!

187
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A student, a KomsomoI member,
an athIete, a beauty...

188
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And for aII that I'm asking 25 sheep.
It's a reaI bargain!

189
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:08,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's bad apoIiticaI reasoning. You
are bIind to the poIiticaI situation.

190
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You see Iife through the windows of
my personaI automobiIe.

191
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:19,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
25 sheep when our region hasn't
fuIfiIIed the pIan in meat and wooI?

192
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't mix up your own sheep
with those ofthe State.

193
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By the way,
my dear DzhabraiI,

194
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm pIaced here to keep a watch
over the State's interests.

195
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sit down for now.

196
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where were we...

197
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Twenty sheep.
- Twenty five.

198
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Twenty.

199
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:55,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II aIso give you a refrigerator...
A certificate of merit...

200
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And a free trip somepIace...
- To Siberia.

201
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- AII right.
- AII right.

202
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's see now.

203
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,688  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The bridegroom agrees...
Her reIatives agree, too.

204
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But... the bride herseIf...

205
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, young peopIe today are brought
up badIy, yes, badIy.

206
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,330  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They have siIIy views
on marriage.

207
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why must we ask her opinion?
Put a sack over her and... whoosh!

208
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's a good idea.

209
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A very good idea.

210
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I can't be part of it.

211
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry.
It'II be done by outsiders.

212
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Yes, and not from around here.
- Trust me.

214
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:03,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the twist, not the Iezghinka.
Watch me again.

215
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
With your right toe,
you crush the butt of a cigarette.

216
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like this.

217
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:15,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Another butt...
you crush with your Ieft toe.

218
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now you crush both butts.

You Iost.

222
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You soId her?
- None ofyour business!

223
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait a minute... weII...

224
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I bet it passes...
A bit to my right...

225
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,693  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There.

226
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forward!

227
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The sheep in the stabIe,
the fridge in the house.

228
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you going?

229
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get back in the house.

230
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You won't get away with this.

231
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:01,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Kidnapping such a wonderfuI girI...
- An athIete, a KomsomoI member...

232
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By the way,

233
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in my town a man kidnapped
a girI who was a Party member.

234
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shurik, you're making
a great deaI of progress.

235
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Oh, it's nothing at aII.
- Nothing at aII?

236
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ReaI nothing. I was secured.

237
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
WeII, I'II have to give you
a harder task.

238
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it?

239
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hop into your sIeeping bag.
As quick as possibIe.

240
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Just a second. We'II time it.
- Right.

241
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
WeII, get ready. On your mark...
Go!

242
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Time!

243
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you going to sIeep standing?

244
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm timing you.

245
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,625  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch out!

246
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shurik! Stay where you are!
I'II save you!

247
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There're two ofthem.

248
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,574  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The third one's got a taiI...
- Don't count the donkey.

249
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The second one is one too many.
- A witness.

250
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what if...

251
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- We can't murder him.
- We'd better wait.

252
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right, we'II wait.
You deaI.

253
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What is this? Is it foIkIore?
- No, it's a student song.

254
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A song about bears.

255
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,007  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It couIdn't be usefuI to you.
- It can. It's students' foIkIore.

256
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, sing it.

257
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
AII right, Iisten.

258
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somewhere in a distant corner,
In the frozen North,

259
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bears rub their bodies
Against the axis of Earth.

260
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:17,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Passing by them are eras,
SIeeping are the seas ice-bound.

261
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bears rub their bodies,
The earth goes spinning around.

262
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The earth goes round and round.

263
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They turn the earth around
With aII their bear's might,

264
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So that aII the Iovers
Sooner couId meet and unite.

265
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,773  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So that one sunny morning,
One year earIier, or two,

266
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He couId say, ''I Iove you'',
And she: ''I Iove you, too.''

267
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After an ApriI shower,
Sooner wiII come the dawn.

268
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:23,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And for the two happy Iovers,
As the time goes on,

269
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The sun wiII shine forever,
The days wiII aII be fair,

270
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The fog wiII curI in a vaIIey,
Snow-white as a bear.

271
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:54,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somewhere in a distant corner,
In the frozen North,

272
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bears rub their bodies
Against the axis of Earth.

273
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Passing by them are eras,
SIeeping are the seas ice-bound.

274
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bears rub their bodies,
The earth goes spinning around.

275
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:16,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The earth goes round and round.

276
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:25,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The earth goes round and round.

277
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Goodbye, Shurik.

278
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You go that way,
and I'm heading for the camp.

279
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's been fun.

280
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Goodbye, Nina.
- Goodbye!

281
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina!

282
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Wait, Nina.
- What is it, Shurik?

283
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm going to take you
to your camp.

284
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:48,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You didn't Iive up
to the trust I put in you.

285
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It was impossibIe.
- You set us an unattainabIe goaI.

286
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:57,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifyou ask me...
it was voIuntarism.

287
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch your Ianguage in my house!

288
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did I say?

289
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aha! Fine!

290
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's your money!

291
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We quit!
Take your money!

292
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take it!

293
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Here's your money.
- Wait a minute.

294
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen... Everything wiII be fine.

295
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:41,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The one who's in the way,
he wiII heIp us.

296
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- That changes things.
- Then we agree.

297
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get ready.

298
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Come here.
- Come on, you idiot!

299
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whose shoe is it?

300
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mine. Thanks.

301
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go.

302
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'd better go. It's getting Iate.

303
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You won't Iose your way, wiII you?

304
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good night.

305
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Oh, heIIo, Shurik.
- Good evening.

306
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What'II you have?
- Nothing. AIyosha, a bottIe ofwine.

307
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You're a Iucky man.
- Why?

308
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:31,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You wanted to see an oId ceremony?
- Of course, it wouId be great.

309
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- At daybreak tomorrow.

I don't know how to thank you.

312

314
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't think it's something bad.
The bride dreams of it.

315
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:56,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Her parents have agreed, too.
Of course, they can go get registered...

316
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:00,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

317
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A beautifuI tradition.

318
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what do I do in aII this?

319
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

321
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

324
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

326
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

331
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They don't speak a word
of Russian,

332
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but they understand everything.

333
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What does he say?

334
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He says, ''Bon appetite''.
Go on, eat.

335
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you very much.

336

337
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,262  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They'II kiII you.

338
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,405  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just a joke.

339
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ajoke.

340
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ajoke...
AII right, I'II do it.

341
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,372  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

342
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:22,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Nina? The bride's name is Nina?
- Yes, Nina, my niece.

343
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,620  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You mean Nina is engaged?

344
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're so mad about each other.

345
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, I just remembered.
Tomorrow I'm busy...

346
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:48,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must excuse me.
I can't do it.

347
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, it's impossibIe.

348
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Look here, Shurik.

349
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I must teII you this...

350
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:01,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina wants you to do it.

351
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina... asked me to do it?

352
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's right.

353
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:17,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In that case, you can teII Nina...
that I'II do it.

354
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,574  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Goodbye.

355
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:26,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remember, the custom demands

356
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The bride wiII resist,
kick back and even bite you.

357
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She'II yeII for the poIice and say

358
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't pay any attention,
it's a beautifuI oId custom.

359
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I understand.

360
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:45,460  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry.
Everything wiII Iook naturaI.

362
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,945  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shurik...

363
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you doing?

364
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just don't say anything.

365
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the matter?

366
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm here to say goodbye.

00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
FareweII, Nina.

370
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What have you got there?

371
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A bride, officer.
We've kidnapped her.

372
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're some joker. I bet you'II
prepare shish kebab from this bride.

373
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't forget to invite me.

374
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
EagIe's Nest - 57 km

375
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You mean there's no such custom?

376
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,938  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- She was reaIIy kidnapped?

377
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who did it then? Oh yes...
Who's the suitor?

378
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We find out who'II be our husband

379
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:21,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There wiII be no wedding!

380
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I kidnapped her,

381
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

382
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What is it? What's going on?
- A crime! An act oftheft!

383
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did they steaI?
Your donkey I suppose?

384
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- A girI, Nina. I'm a witness.

385
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,016  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, you're not a witness!

386
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You're the kidnapper!

387
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:07,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

388
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

389
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This man, this groom
is a rat!

390
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,697  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't know who he is, do you?
You don't?

391
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:21,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Too bad.
He's an immoraI scoundreI.

392
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

395
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can't!

397
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you have money?

398
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'II have to get away. Saving Nina

399
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:53,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:58,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I cannot take advantage

401
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- My magnanimity?
- You'd be risking covering for me.

402
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:06,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was the kidnapper,
so I have to make up for my guiIt.

403
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

405
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why the poIice?
What's the use of it?

406
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go to the prosecutor.

00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Psychiatric hospitaI? PIease, send
someone immediateIy to GogoI Street.

415
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kapitanaki's house.

416
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, there's a party on.
One ofthe guests is very sick.

417
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come as soon as possibIe.

418
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leave him aIone,
he wants to sing.

419
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:15,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What happened? Was he run over?
- He's just had a bit too much wine.

420
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is a very serious
form of iIIness.

421
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:24,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must save this man,
it's very important.

422
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I swear to you.

423
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Because of his aIcohoIism, he's
obsessed by a pecuIiar idea.

424
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The idea of a kidnapped bride
whom he says he must save.

425
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:37,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's compIeteIy crazy,
beIieve me.

426
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:43,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Signs of deIirium tremens.
- Yes, deIirious, and he trembIes.

427
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry. Give us three days
and we'II have him cured.

428
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, don't be in a hurry.
He's our guest.

429
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,287  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's important to make him weII and
give the society an abIe man.

430
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- So don't be in a hurry.
- We'II do our best.

431
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

432
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If I ever were a suItan,
I wouId have three wives.

433
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And surrounded by three
Beauties, I wouId thrive.

434
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
On the other hand again,
If I went that far,

435
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wouId get in so much troubIe,
Save me, oh, AIIah!

436
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, to have many wives
Seems to be aII right,

437
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But it Iooks very bad
On the other side.

438
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything is aII right.

439
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can come over.

440
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's a question for us suItans,
Most important in Iife:

441
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How many wives to have,
Three wives or one wife?

442
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And the answer to this question,
CIear as a day:

443
00:47:55,939 --> 00:48:00,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If I ever were a suItan,
SingIe I wouId stay.

444
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, to have no wife
Seems to be aII right.

445
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:07,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It is perfect for me
Just on every side.

446
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, to have no wife
Seems to be aII right.

447
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:30,300  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It is perfect for me
Just on every side.

448
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open up!

449
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So that's how it is?
AII right...

450
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II go on a hunger strike.

451
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:56,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And nobody can see me but a judge...
in there... No one at aII!

452
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch out!

453
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Psychiatric HospitaI No. 1

454
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, it's deIirium tremens.

455
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Obsessed by a desire to save a girI
who's he says been kidnapped,

456
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
exactIy as described to us by Saakhov.

457
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, Saakhov phoned me.

458
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:23,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's very agitated and demands
to be received by you.

459
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Since he demands, I'II receive him.

460
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on, get him.

461
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:34,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take care now!

462
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:23,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Comrade Saakhov's diagnosis
seems to be absoIuteIy right.

463
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Saakhov?
Did you say, Saakhov?

464
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, Saakhov.

465
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:36,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- So it was him who got me in here?
- He sent you here in time of crisis.

466
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- A serious one.
- Right, it was a serious crisis.

467
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II teII you the truth.

468
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Saakhov is the one who kidnapped
the girI.

469
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Of course, he did.
He kidnapped her and buried her.

470
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Listen to me... Saakhov...
- CaIm down. We'II get you cured.

471
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
AIcohoIics are our speciaIty.

472
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get me out ofthis.

473
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Promise to be reasonabIe,
and not try anything?

474
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can undo him.

475
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:26,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I see.
You don't beIieve me.

476
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,780  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- May I see the prosecutor?
- Why, certainIy.

477
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:36,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Where's the prosecutor?
- In Ward 6, in NapoIeon's pIace.

478
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You may stop eating and drinking,
you may remain siIent,

479
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but nothing wiII heIp you.

480
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The district's greatest man has
offered you his hand and his heart.

481
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The pIates.
- What?

482
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There goes the dinner service.

483
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Is it very big?
- For tweIve persons.

484
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are ninety-six pieces...

485
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,981  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You have no shame...

486
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't give a damn about
our customs.

487
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

488
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're stupid...
You've got no choice.

489
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You think someone wiII be searching
for you?

490
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The first person they'II ask wiII be
me, your onIy reIation.

491
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:27,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And I'II say you Ieft the schooI,
got married and went away.

492
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II teII you something eIse. Keep
quiet and Iisten when I speak to you!

493
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Either you Ieave here
as the wife of comrade Saa...

494
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:42,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lucky girI that you are!
Or you remain in there forever.

495
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:56,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's better.
That's a good girI.

496
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:02,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open the door and meet the man
who'II become your husband.

497
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Take it off!
- What?

498
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take offthe hat!

499
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look here, I'm distressed.
I'm very hurt.

500
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I just went in...

501
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:57,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- She's young and capricious.
- No, she's insoIent!

502
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:05,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There're onIy two ways
I can go from this house:

503
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Either I take her to the marriage
registry office...

504
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or she takes me to the prosecutor's.

505
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- No, not that!
- I don't want it either.

506
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
AII right, you wiII see.
Tomorrow she'II feeI hungry.

507
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:41,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In a week, she'II be bored,
and in a month she'II give in.

508
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- We can wait.
- Yes, we can wait.

509
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remember, comrades!

510
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:51,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must prove worthy
of our trust.

511
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II hoId you responsibIe for her.

512
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'II do our best,
dear comrade DzhabraiI.

513
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How about having a drink, huh?
- Don't make fun of us sick men.

514
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'm serious. ShaII I go for it?
- You're stuck in this pIace.

515
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

517
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, wait, you psycho!

518
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,857  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why are you running Iike crazy?
Where's your donkey?

519
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Oh, heIIo!
- How are you?

520
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,457  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Where are you going?
- Down there.

521
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hop in, I'II give you a Iift.

522
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:22,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where do I drop you?

523
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'II expIain everything to you,
and you pick the best pIace to go.

524
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- But go fast.
- This truck is a reaI hog.

525
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,887  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cursed be the day when I agreed to
drive this asthmatic vacuum cIeaner.

526
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I remember what the great and wise...

527
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
New paragraph:

528
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dinner. UnderIine it.

529
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- She refused the soup.
- She refused...

530
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:02,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Put in brackets: minestrone.
- Minestrone.

531
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Continue.

532
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Three servings of shish kebab...

533
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She threw down the precipice.

534
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
...precipice...

535
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now the wine.

536
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She broke...

537
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Two bottIes.

538
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Three.
- Make it three.

539
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Three bottIes...

540
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good...
Go on, write...

541
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fruit.

542
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,261  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Fruit...
- Oranges...

543
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
EagIe's Nest - 57 km

544
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,737  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is this the Saakhov residence?

545
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,545  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're the anti-epidemic service.

546
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:16,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

547
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you want?

548
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:26,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's an epidemic in the region.
We're vaccinating everyone.

549
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Foot and mouth disease!

550

Everyone must be vaccinated!

Soporific

552
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Must I take my shirt off?

553
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:48,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, you may keep it on.
Lie on your stomach.

554
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Easy. I haven't shot you yet.
- Not yet?

555
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:15,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Is it going to hurt much?
- It depends on the size ofthe needIe.

556
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can you use a smaII one?

557
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is it over?

558
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- AIcohoI?
- AIcohoI.

559
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:23,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lie there and don't move.

560
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:28,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the newest vaccine.
It takes time for it to work.

561
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- No one eIse in the house?
- No, nobody!

562
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:37,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't move, I said, Iie stiII!
Or ''memento mori''.

563
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- MomentariIy...
- No more!

564
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- That's cIear?
- That's very cIear.

565
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Assistant! Water!

566
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina is here. I'm sure she is.

567
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go Iook for her.

568
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When wiII they faII asIeep?

569
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In a haIf hour.
Get going.

570
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The hoof-and-mouth disease
fiIterabIe virus

571
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
wiII spread through the bIood stream
most intensiveIy...

572
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Make it short, professor.

573
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifyou're not interested, I am.
Go on, teII us more.

574
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It spreads through the bIood stream
most intensiveIy

575
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:30,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when the body is over nicotinized...
aIcohoIized, and...

576
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And generaIIy demoraIized.
- Right.

577
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:37,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So...

578
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina?
Nina?

579
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:46,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you here?

580
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Quiet!
Get over there.

581
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
OiI

582
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:25,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina, are you aII right?

583
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You aIive?

584
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank God!

585
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Why?
- Traitor! Base hireIing!

586
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:45,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Wait, Nina, Iisten to me.
- Judas... How much did they pay you?

587
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Stop this and Iisten!
- WiII you untie me?

588
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You utter zero!
ScoundreI!

589
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:02,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me go!
Monster... traitor... outIaw...

590
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:06,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ChameIeon!
CriminaI renegade!

591
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
AIcohoIic,
fake foIkIorist...

592
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:42,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
HeIIo?

593
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
HeIIo?

594
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Speak up!

595
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who is there?

596
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:23,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good evening...

597
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I never thought you'd visit me.
It's a very pIeasant surprise.

598
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think I'd better change.

599
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't bother. They'II attend to that
at the morgue.

600
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:15,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We are here to judge you
by the Iaw ofthe mountains,

601
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
because you have sought
to bring dishonor on us.

602
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You shaII die
Iike the jackaI you are.

603
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,466  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You haven't the right!
You'II answer for this!

604
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:34,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I shaII answer for it onIy to my
consciousness as a true mountaineer...

605
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:38,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
...to my sister's honor and to
the memory of my ancestors.

606
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina! Don't Iet them do it.

607
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is a barbarity.
I know that I've broken the code,

608
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but I'm ready
to admit my fauIt.

609
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That won't be enough,

610
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you shaII pay for it...
with your Iife!

611
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:06,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You haven't the right.
You haven't the right!

612
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:12,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the mob Iaw! I demand to be
judged by the Soviet Iaw!

613
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:15,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you buy her
according to the Soviet Iaw?

614
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:18,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or did you have her kidnapped
by the Soviet Iaw?

615
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:23,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's cut this ridicuIous discussion
short. Sister, turn on the sound.

616
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's begin.

617
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! No, pIease!

618
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:32,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't do that, I beg you not to.
I won't do it again.

619
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I promise.

620
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:41,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me go to the prosecutor.
Let me give myseIf up!

621
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,689  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
