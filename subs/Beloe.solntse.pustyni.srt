1
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:43,080
And another thing I must tell you,
my dearest Katerina Matveyevna:

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,524
you're appearing to me
as a purest swan,

3
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:54,898
like you swim to wherever you need
to go, or on your errands...

4
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:58,971
only it takes my breath away,
so happy I feel,

5
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,703
as though I was shot pointblank
from a cannon.

6
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:12,115

16
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,671
You should know,
my dearest Katerina Matveyevna,

17
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:13,634
that to date, the class battles have
been completed by and large,

18
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:17,317
and the day of worldwide liberation
is coming.

19
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:21,460
So it's now time for me
to come back home

20
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,442
and build a new life

21
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,924
in my native land, so dear to my heart.

22
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,320
Two o'clock.

23
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:20,333
Have you been here long?

24
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,314
It's just my luck!

25
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,637
Back in hospital I'd sworn to myself:
as soon as I have a discharge,

26
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:55,379
I'll go straight home,
and not get into any mess.

27
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,124
I've dug up two like you,
and nothing happened...

28
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,326
But the third one...

29
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,599
I pulled him out, and he got at my
throat. A bandit he was.

30
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,462
That's how it turned out. Buried by
his own. I hardly beat him off.

31
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:23,400
Now I'll dig you up,
and good bye.

32
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:38,911
THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN

33
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,625
Hands down!

34
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:24,624
A real beast...
that Black Abdullah.

35
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:27,326
Has no pity for anyone.

36
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:31,810
If we came here a bit later,
he would've killed all of them.

37
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:38,935
Why did he do it, Commander? What for?

38
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,397
He's a bandit!

39
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:45,790
When we finally got to these parts,
Abdullah decided to go abroad

40
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:50,013
and shoot his harem...
so that no man would have them.

41
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:54,266
No, with the women, we can't catch up
with Abdullah.

42
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,409
That's why he wanted to do away with
them, because they hindered him.

43
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,881
But we can't abandon them either.

44
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,888
Here, some dried bread and barley
for your trip.

45
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,283
I'm being late. Discharged six months
ago, I still knock about those sands.

46
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,435
I haven't been home for years.

47
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:22,587
There you go. It will last you
for a while.

48
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,260
You'll get something else in Pedzhent,
but I can't give you any more, sorry.

49
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:31,794
I've made quite a detour as it is,
now I'm going straight ahead.

50
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,276
Once I get as far as the Volga,
Samara will be at a stone's throw.

51
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:39,770
I'll have no peace as long as Dzhavdet
is alive. Why have you dug me up?

52
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,402
Sure, a dead man doesn't have
to worry about anything,

53
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:45,814
but it's so boring.

54
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:48,406
What is it between you and that
Dzhavdet?

55
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:52,779
He killed my father...

56
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,481
...buried me,

57
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:58,824
took my four sheep,

58
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:02,256
that was all I had.

59
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,258
That... what's his name... Dzhavdet,

60
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,261
is he with Black Abdullah or what?

61
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,464
They hate each other.
Dzhavdet is a coward.

62
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:15,266
Abdullah is a warrior.

63
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,529
Well, Sayid...
So long!

64
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:14,269
Look, Commander.

65
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:37,356
In the old fortress, you should've
taken him through the chimney.

66
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,558
Through the chimney?

67
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:45,772
Sukhov, give us a hand. With you,
we'll finish him off in a jiffy.

68
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:51,346
You alone are worth a whole platoon,
if not a company.

69
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:56,530
East is a delicate matter.

70
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:05,307
- How come you're here?
- They were shooting.

71
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,719
Look, at least take the women.

72
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,543
Imagine, I've been sitting three days
by the old fortress, with no sleep.

73
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:19,727
I waited for Abdullah to come back for
his harem. They tie me hand and foot!

74
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,228
Rakhimov!

75
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:25,631
- I'm going home.
- Take them, and we'll get Abdullah.

76
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:27,563
He's at Dry Spring now.

77
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:31,826
You just take them as far as Pedzhent,
they will be safer there.

78
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:35,239
And I'll give you a man,
a horse, some cereal...

79
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,360
What do you say, Sukhov?

80
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,372
Sukhov...

81
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:43,374
Yes, I guess there're none of our men
as far as 300 versts from here now.

82
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,818
- That's right.
- Then it's agreed.

83
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,561
Mount!

84
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:54,313
Comrade women!
Don't be afraid!

85
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:57,545
We'll finish off
your exploiting husband,

86
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:00,387
but as of now, you're under command
of Comrade Sukhov.

87
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:04,760
He will feed you and protect you...
he's a good man.

88
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:06,552
Hold it!

89
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:09,223
Wait!

90
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:10,995
Stop!

91
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,634
Damn it!

92
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:31,930
Am I going to wander about this
desert for the rest of my life?

93
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:39,476
Get up!

94
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,549
Don't go to Pedzhent.

95
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,822
Abdullah will come there.

96
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:49,953
We'll wait and see.

97
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,228
Give him the horse.

98
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,834
Here is the list, Comrade Sukhov.

99
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:08,907
Zarina,

100
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:12,470
Djamilya,

101
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:14,902
Giuzel,

102
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,504
Sayida,

103
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:21,617
Khafiza,

104
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,409
Zukhra,

105
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:26,510
Leyla,

106
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:29,623
Zulfia,

107
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:30,994
Gyulchatai.

108
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:34,816
Gyulchatai!

109
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,223
Right turn...

110
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:52,699
Follow me, young ladies.

111
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:03,207
My heart is longing for you,
my beloved Katerina Matveyevna,

112
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:05,309
like a crane is longing for the sky.

113
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,921
However, there's a hitch.

114
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:11,483
I think it will delay me for another
three days, no more.

115
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:15,606
Exactly, I was charged,
as a class-conscious soldier,

116
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,889
to accompany a group of comrades
from our brotherly East.

117
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,483
I must admit that
they happen to be agreeable folks,

118
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,526
I'd even say, warm ones, with zest.

119
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,660
So my feet are running now over
hot sands in the opposite direction,

120
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,915
as I am bound
by my revolutionary duty.

121
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:50,282
THIRD DAY

122
00:14:52,914 --> 00:14:58,188
I would also like to inform you
that our deployment goes on smoothly,

123
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:02,781
in the atmosphere of fraternal unity
and harmony.

124
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:06,724
We're just treading sands,
not sighing for anything,

125
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:13,489
except for you, my only
and unforgettable Katerina Matveyevna.

126
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,502
So don't you be grieving, either.

127
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:20,304
It does no good.

128
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:30,856
I beg you! Not in the museum!
We have most precious things here.

129
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:32,177
Wait.

130
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,150
- Who are you?
- I'm the museum's curator.

131
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,222
- My name is Lebedev.
- I see.

132
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:44,155
- Where's the populace?
- Hiding. Bringing a harem in here!

133
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:46,227
Look here, Comrade Curator,

134
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:51,621
those nine liberated women of the East
are very precious things, too...

135
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:54,563
And let's not argue about it.
Any questions?

136
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:56,845
No questions.
Follow me!

137
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,767
All right, you'll rest here for a day.

138
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,421
Djamilya,
Zarina, Giuzel,

139
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:35,163
Sayida, Khafiza, Zukhra,

140
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:38,435
Leyla, Zulfia, Gyulchatai.

141
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:40,377
Gyulchatai!

142
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:43,169
"MUSEUM OF THE RED EAST"

143
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:55,648
Good bye, young ladies!

144
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:02,513
Comrade Sukhov!

145
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:07,256
- Maybe you'll stay for another day?
- Too much of a good thing.

146
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:09,518
- Sukhov!
- Don't be scared!

147
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:12,450
Tomorrow Rakhimov will arrive,
he will take you on from here.

148
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,893
Sayid, good luck to you!

149
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,635
I'll just take a swim in the sea,
and off I go!

150
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,430
Don't let yourself be buried again.

151
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:55,096
Monsters!
Barbarians!

152
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,410
How are you?

153
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,608
Hands up!

154
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:27,129
To Red Army soldier Sukhov.

155
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,620
Personalized.

156
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:38,568
From Brigade Commander M.N. Kovun.

157
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:53,108
Abdullah had eleven wives. What have
you done to the other two?

158
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,381
You just wait, Abdullah will come
and tear your tongue out.

159
00:20:58,152 --> 00:21:01,214
- Why don't you say something?
- Saving my tongue.

160
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:07,589
Shall I finish you off right away
or you want to be tortured first?

161
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,321
I'd rather be tortured.

162
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:30,676
Semyon!
Ride to Abdullah!

163
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:49,490
Don't!
Come on, move!

164
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:30,490
How come you're here?

165
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:34,222
They were shooting.

166
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:58,340
Abdullah got a lot of men.

167
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:02,603
That's right.

168
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm writing to you once again,
my dearest Katerina Matveyevna,

169
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:15,483
now that I've got a spare minute.

170
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:19,246
The warm sun is making me purr,

171
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:22,648
like our tomcat Vaska when he's
basking in it, perched on the hedge.

172
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,132
We're sitting now on the sand
by the very blue sea,

173
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:31,054
not disturbed by anything.

174
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:36,328
The sun is so bright here
that it makes you see white.

175
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:37,539
Comrade Sukhov!

176
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,463
What if Rakhimov is delayed?
What happens to us then?

177
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:45,295
Abdullah will kill us because of them.

178
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:58,144
Greetings, fathers!

179
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:09,763
DYNAMITE

180
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:12,054
We beg your pardon.

181
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,124
Where did you get it?

182
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:29,367
We've been sitting here for a long
time.

183
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:41,546
Petrukha!

184
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,550
- Take the box. We can use it.
- Right.

185
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:52,504
And tell the girls there will be no
Abdullah, you got it?

186
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,015
Got it!

187
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:27,009
- What is it? - Go away!
Abdullah'll be here tomorrow.

188
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,342
But I can't go now. You see
how it turned out. Stay on, Sayid.

189
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:32,343
There's no Dzhavdet here.

190
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:35,215
Goodbye, then.

191
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,223
"DORMITORY FOR LIBERATED
WOMEN OF THE EAST"

192
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:49,526
- They took most valuable exhibits.
- What do you mean, exhibits?

193
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:53,619
- I told them to take only worn rugs.
- But these are the 11th century!

194
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,572
As you were!

195
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,428
Don't be afraid.
He's our master.

196
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:43,596
Master! No one must see
our faces. Only you.

197
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:47,298
You're our new husband.
Tell your man not to come here.

198
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:50,281
Comrade women!

199
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,073
The Revolution has made you free.

200
00:26:54,444 --> 00:26:57,606
No one owns you anymore.
There's no master.

201
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:01,279
You can call me simply
Comrade Sukhov.

202
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:03,680
You may forget your
accursed past.

203
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:10,295
You will work freely now, and each
of you will have a separate husband.

204
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:13,027
Any questions?

205
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,631
No questions.

206
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:44,110
"DOWN WITH PREJUDICES!
WOMAN IS A HUMAN BEING, TOO"

207
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:02,053
Gyulchatai!

208
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:05,556
Show your face.

209
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,321
Don't think I'm just playing...
I may have serious intentions.

210
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:18,165
I don't mind you were someone's
wife. You're just right for me.

211
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,076
I like spirited girls.

212
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:24,970
I can even propose to you.

213
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:29,123
I've got a good, kind mother.
Everyone respects her.

214
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:32,105
- Come on, show your face.
- As you were!

215
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:34,477
Hold it!

216
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:38,380
- Gyulchatai!
- Yes, master.

217
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,943
Go announce a reveille to the girls.
Hold it!

218
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:44,284
As of today, I appoint you

219
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:47,557
to be in charge at the dormitory here,
responsible for the order.

220
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,698
- Any questions?
- No.

221
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,501
The master has appointed me
his favorite wife.

222
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,975
Comrade Sukhov, I'm very serious,
I want to marry her.

223
00:28:59,145 --> 00:29:02,157
I just want to see her face, what if
she looks like a crocodile.

224
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:06,370
Go to the shore. Find the white house,
a former czarist custom house.

225
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,312
Find out who's there now.

226
00:29:56,217 --> 00:29:58,179
Freeze!
Hands up!

227
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:20,155
D'you know whose house you got in?

228
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:23,967
- Answer me!
- I don't know.

229
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,441
Have you never... heard of Vereschagin?

230
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:32,634
What have I come to!

231
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:38,068
In the old times,
everyone knew me here.

232
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:39,979
I had them all in my hand.

233
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,142
Now they forgot.

234
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,271
Hold it!

235
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:27,614
Stop, I said!

236
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,631
Why did you kill my men, Sayid?

237
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:55,425
I sent them to tell you not to look
for Dzhavdet at Dry Spring.

238
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:58,037
He's not there.
Go back to Pedzhent.

239
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,429
Your father and my father were
friends.

240
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,202
When you happen to get a good
companion, the road comes easier.

241
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,618
Your Honorable Excellence,

242
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:30,460
Lady Separation.

243
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:35,914
We've become like one with you,
Though with no intention.

244
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:41,038
Letter in the envelope,
Don't tear it, enough!

245
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:46,032
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love...

246
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:51,896
Letter in the envelope,
Don't tear it, enough!

247
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:57,040
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love...

248
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:02,514
Your Honorable Excellence,

249
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,976
Dear Lady Luck.

250
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,109
Some you grace with fortune,

251
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:12,321
Others you would duck.

252
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:19,196
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

253
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:25,130
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

254
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:32,896
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

255
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,602
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

256
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:12,095
Hey, good man!
Have you got a light?

257
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,902
- Where are you going?
- That's Comrade Sukhov.

258
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,917
So you say it's Sukhov?

259
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:33,901
Let's check out
that Sukhov.

260
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:49,462
Oh God, forgive me my sins...

261
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,354
Catch it!

262
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:16,883
Well, come on in!

263
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:29,562
- Have you seen the peacocks
in the yard? - I have.

264
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:33,855
I traded them in... for my uniform.

265
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:35,856
Petrukha!

266
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:38,959
I don't drink.

267
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,061
Good for you.

268
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:46,204
I'm going to finish this
and give up, too.

269
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:47,365
Drink up!

270
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,671
Sit down!

271
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:03,577
I like your Petrukha very much.

272
00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:07,210
Can you give me a machine-gun?

273
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:19,058
- Are you waiting for Abdullah?
- Yes.

274
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,334
Look, Sukhov,

275
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:31,007
when I had a custom house here,
there were the smugglers.

276
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:34,870
There's no custom house now,
there're no smugglers.

277
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,462
In short, I made peace with Abdullah.

278
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:41,595
Whites or Reds,
they make no difference to me.

279
00:36:41,975 --> 00:36:43,997
Whether it's Abdullah,
or it's you.

280
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,302
If I went with you,
that would be different.

281
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:54,144
What's the problem, then?

282
00:36:57,386 --> 00:36:58,357
Let's go.

283
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,350
Let's go.

284
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,259
Let's go.

285
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,661
Hello.

286
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:22,535
Hello.

287
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,950
Guys!

288
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:35,114
Come back!

289
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:39,117
What did you tell me?

290
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:46,192
What solemn promises you gave me?
Have you gone crazy at your age?

291
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:47,293
Nastasya...

292
00:37:47,593 --> 00:37:50,255
You'd ruined the best years of my
life,

293
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:53,057
and now you want to make me
a widow?

294
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,063
Pasha!

295
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:03,965
Pasha dear!
Pasha!

296
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,568
Forgive me, for Christ's sake!

297
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:10,910
Don't go!
Don't go with them!

298
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:14,133
They'll get you killed
just for nothing!

299
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,811
Well, guys...

300
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,014
I can't give you the machine-gun.

301
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:32,516
We understand.

302
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,439
So, it's the peacocks, right?

303
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:16,318
Who told you to come here?

304
00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:44,939
- Have you measured it?
- Exactly three and a half meters!

305
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:52,075
- Will it catch fire?
- It should.

306
00:39:52,845 --> 00:39:54,817
As soon as it does, start counting.

307
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:20,906
Forty two!

308
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,312
They can go in the motor boat now.

309
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,477
They want to get behind the border.

310
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:39,019
After they start the motor,
42 seconds and... boom!

311
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:42,282
That's right.

312
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:45,814
Clean up here.

313
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,858
The geese...

314
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:08,901
They may have come from our parts,
or just flown over there.

315
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:12,304
- Where are you from?
- A village near Kursk.

316
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:17,277
Never been there. I left home
when I was a kid like you...

317
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:21,470
I've been knocked around the whole
world...

318
00:41:22,051 --> 00:41:24,102
- From the Amur river...
- The Amur river?

319
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,414
...to Turkestan.

320
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,751
Before he died, my father said:

321
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,464
"Abdullah, all my life I was poor,

322
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,286
and I wish that God send you
an expensive robe

323
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:45,758
and a beautiful harness for your
horse."

324
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,101
I waited for a long time,
then God said:

325
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:53,064
"Mount your horse and take everything
you want yourself,

326
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:55,976
if you're a brave and strong man."

327
00:41:56,806 --> 00:42:00,179
My father didn't say anything.
Dzhavdet killed him in the back.

328
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,472
Your father was a wise man,

329
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:07,514
but who on this earth knows
what is good and what is bad?

330
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:10,316
The dagger's good for the one
who has it,

331
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:17,081
and bad for the one who hasn't it...
at the right time.

332
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:09,890
Oh, Allah, where's he, that husband
of ours?

333
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:12,352
It's all her fault,

334
00:43:14,263 --> 00:43:15,284
Gyulchatai's!

335
00:43:17,405 --> 00:43:20,378
When I was Abdullah's favorite wife,
you saw him every day.

336
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,529
And he beat us every day.

337
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,832
- Our husband forgot about us before
he knew us. - Why, we're not that bad.

338
00:43:27,343 --> 00:43:31,366
Maybe, Gyulchatai doesn't
caress him well enough?

339
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:34,778
- Or he doesn't like the way she dresses?
- Or perhaps...

340
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:55,053
What's the matter?

341
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,418
How old are you?

342
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,973
Don't even think of that.

343
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:13,437
Or maybe we'd really get you married?
To Petrukha, in lawful wedlock.

344
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,440
The boy is not married,
he wants to take you to his mother.

345
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:22,063
- I'm your wife.
- My wife is at home.

346
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:25,435
Can't you tell her that
Gyulchatai's your favorite wife?

347
00:44:25,786 --> 00:44:27,417
She won't be offended, will she?

348
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:30,749
She will!

349
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,742
How many times must I explain it?
We're supposed to have only one wife.

350
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:36,754
Do you understand?
One!

351
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:44,229
Wouldn't you like your husband to love,
give presents to and caress only you?

352
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,761
- You think it's bad?
- It's good.

353
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:52,035
One wife loves,

354
00:44:52,405 --> 00:44:56,168
one makes clothes,
one cooks,

355
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:58,840
one feeds the children...

356
00:45:02,272 --> 00:45:06,045
- One wife doing all this?
- Nothing can be done about that.

357
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:08,837
- It's hard.
- Sure it's hard.

358
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,253
All right, good night now.
We'll talk tomorrow.

359
00:46:53,754 --> 00:46:56,386
Ibragim!
That's lbragim's robe!

360
00:46:58,368 --> 00:46:59,959
Poor lbragim!

361
00:47:08,135 --> 00:47:10,907
Until I catch them,
you'll stay with us.

362
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:29,421
I would also like to tell you,
Katerina Matveyevna,

363
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:34,384
that sometimes I get so sick
at my heart,

364
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:37,787
such sadness grips me with its claws,

365
00:47:38,227 --> 00:47:41,680
when I'm wondering how you're
doing over there.

366
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,981
What troubles you?

367
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:47,194
Have you coped with hay making or not?

368
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:50,966
The grass must have been abundant
this year...

369
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:54,999
Well, our separation won't last
long now.

370
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:57,701
I'll give a bit of help
to this group of comrades,

371
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,213
settle some other problems,

372
00:48:01,204 --> 00:48:04,977
and make my way in your direction,
my invaluable Katerina Matveyevna.

373
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:10,451
Now I beg your pardon, there is
a small hitch. I'll finish next time.

374
00:48:18,256 --> 00:48:19,848
Come out, if you're there!

375
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:24,181
We've been loyal to you, master!

376
00:48:26,432 --> 00:48:27,863
Djamilya...

377
00:48:28,394 --> 00:48:33,658
You've been my favorite wife, haven't
you? Have I ever hurt you?

378
00:48:34,698 --> 00:48:36,670
Why aren't you dead?

379
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:02,639
Drop the gun...

380
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:04,981
If you turn back, I'll shoot.

381
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:06,282
Drop it!

382
00:49:08,793 --> 00:49:09,994
Hands up!

383
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:19,872
Your dagger.

384
00:49:26,837 --> 00:49:28,778
Make five steps forward.

385
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:56,228
And tell your hirelings to get out
of the yard.

386
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:00,331
I'll let you free as soon as your men
leave Pedzhent.

387
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,202
I never miss.

388
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:25,039
Abdullah, you may put your hands down.

389
00:50:28,352 --> 00:50:29,653
Makhmud!

390
00:50:31,784 --> 00:50:33,646
Gallop to the shore, all of you!

391
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:37,749
Load the boat and put it on the water.

392
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:40,761
I'm staying here... as a guest.

393
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:43,753
But if I'm not there by noon,
come back to settle a score...

394
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:46,926
...for the hospitality.
Get out!

395
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:00,105
Petrukha!

396
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:04,639
You stay here.

397
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,842
I'm going to the shore.
To see what the bandits are doing.

398
00:51:14,746 --> 00:51:16,647
They stole Abdullah!

399
00:51:38,403 --> 00:51:40,275
Don't tell anyone...

400
00:51:42,196 --> 00:51:43,667
You better not.

401
00:52:17,462 --> 00:52:19,023
They'll cheat you.

402
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:22,125
They'll board the boat.

403
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:26,299
You'll let Abdullah free,
and they'll be back.

404
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,612
I don't think so.

405
00:52:35,045 --> 00:52:37,136
Caviar again!

406
00:52:37,647 --> 00:52:40,709
I'm fed up with eating the damn
thing every day!

407
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,901
Couldn't you get some bread?

408
00:52:45,152 --> 00:52:47,714
How can I get it now?

409
00:52:47,854 --> 00:52:50,226
Eat it! You got to eat something
after drinking.

410
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:09,270
Everyone in the village is dead scared.

411
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:13,663
People don't even poke their noses
out of doors.

412
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:17,936
The Revolutionary Committee's
Commissioner and the militia man

413
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:19,207
have not returned from the city yet.

414
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:22,200
And that red-haired one who was here

415
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,272
is said to have gotten Abdullah
himself.

416
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:30,155
I don't like all this.

417
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:34,078
Oh, God!

418
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:37,751
Don't you get into this,
don't butt in!

419
00:53:38,321 --> 00:53:40,763
You have done your share
of fighting.

420
00:53:57,135 --> 00:53:58,606
Gyulchatai!

421
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:08,604
Show your face.

422
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:11,676
Come on, show it.

423
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,020
Is someone sneaking around?

424
00:54:25,726 --> 00:54:26,887
Gyulchatai.

425
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:31,280
Gyulchatai!

426
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:36,694
Bring some water.

427
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,881
Hands up!

428
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:02,013
Oh, it's you?
What are you doing there?

429
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:04,615
Please, don't say a word to anyone.

430
00:55:04,755 --> 00:55:06,686
We have a hiding place here.

431
00:55:46,215 --> 00:55:47,777
Show your face.

432
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:08,572
Petrukha!

433
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:18,643
Go away now. Hurry.

434
00:57:19,084 --> 00:57:21,045
You can't stay here alone.

435
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:22,746
I can't leave either.

436
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:26,849
- Abdullah will kill the women.
- Abdullah will kill you.

437
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,061
They're his wives.

438
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:36,556
- Goodbye.
- I counted on you.

439
00:57:36,797 --> 00:57:41,750
If I'm killed, who's going
to take vengeance on Dzhavdet?

440
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:46,364
I counted on you, Sayid.

441
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:23,061
And if Fate wills for us
not to see each other again,

442
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:26,233
Katerina Matveyevna, you should know

443
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,876
that I have been and will be,
to my last breath,

444
00:58:30,076 --> 00:58:32,628
devoted only to you alone.

445
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:37,001
And since it may happen that
I'm buried forever in these sands,

446
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:40,213
this unaccustomed thought
even making me feel sad...

447
00:58:42,245 --> 00:58:46,508
Or maybe it's because I've met lately

448
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:51,011
mostly very warm people,
I'd even say, delicate people.

449
00:58:53,953 --> 00:58:56,115
Bearing witness to this is...

450
00:58:56,855 --> 00:59:00,228
fighter for the happiness of working
people of the whole world,

451
00:59:00,898 --> 00:59:05,522
member of the Caspian International
Revolutionary Proletarian Regiment

452
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:08,064
named after Comrade August Bebel,

453
00:59:08,264 --> 00:59:09,735
Red Army man...

454
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:13,688
Fyodor lvanovich Sukhov.

455
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:25,006
Have the women left, curator?

456
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:28,909
I detained them.
Look, this is an underground passage.

457
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,883
It leads to the seashore. It was dug
at the time of the Samanid Dynasty.

458
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:38,056
No one has used it
in the last 400 years.

459
00:59:54,728 --> 00:59:56,499
They're not here!

460
00:59:58,801 --> 01:00:00,902
They couldn't have gone far.

461
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:04,535
Let go of my hand.
Let go, I said.

462
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:08,248
- Why this violence?
- Let him go, Akhmed.

463
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:12,571
Stop this plunder now!

464
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:15,903
There're no women here.
And I don't know anything about...

465
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:19,586
There must be an underground passage
here...

466
01:00:41,832 --> 01:00:42,853
Get down!

467
01:00:46,536 --> 01:00:47,767
Cling to the ground!

468
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,820
Follow me!

469
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:49,182
There's no one here!

470
01:01:53,555 --> 01:01:54,986
They couldn't bury them in the sand.

471
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,860
No one here either.

472
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:28,611
We can't open it up.

473
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,173
- We could blow it up.
- We don't have any grenades.

474
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,779
Leave at least one bullet, Abdullah,

475
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,451
to shoot ourselves with.

476
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:49,056
Your Honorable Excellence,

477
01:02:50,497 --> 01:02:55,591
Lady Foreign Land.

478
01:02:58,002 --> 01:03:01,555
Your embrace is very hot,

479
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:05,768
But to love you can't.

480
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,003
In your seductive mire

481
01:03:12,603 --> 01:03:15,776
Don't call me, enough.

482
01:03:16,946 --> 01:03:20,049
No luck in dying,

483
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:24,712
There'll be luck in love...

484
01:03:25,753 --> 01:03:29,456
Your Honorable Excellence,

485
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:35,460
Dear Lady Victory.

486
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:41,855
It seems my song is over...

487
01:03:43,496 --> 01:03:44,867
Still singing?

488
01:03:51,232 --> 01:03:54,464
I came from Abdullah.
We've run out of grenades,

489
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:57,006
and you've got a whole supply.

490
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:02,100
Stop it!

491
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,642
There'll be luck in love!

492
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:14,449
And stand up when a lieutenant
is talking to you.

493
01:04:28,569 --> 01:04:32,021
Devils, stop your crying

494
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,934
And swearing on blood!

495
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:40,938
No luck in dying...

496
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:43,230
He's got wrong grenades.

497
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:50,045
It's full.

498
01:04:52,747 --> 01:04:54,118
Abdullah!

499
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:58,921
Are you still wearing a yashmak, or
you've changed into men's clothes?

500
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:03,915
Abdullah, your wives are very tender.

501
01:05:04,225 --> 01:05:07,758
- I'm enjoying them.
- I'm giving them to you.

502
01:05:07,998 --> 01:05:10,760
When I set oil on fire,
you'll enjoy it even better.

503
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,432
You'll enjoy it very much.

504
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:20,507
They give us no peace.
One feels like running away.

505
01:05:21,438 --> 01:05:24,890
Some want grenades...
Others want bullets...

506
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:27,913
May the devil take them!

507
01:05:31,575 --> 01:05:34,607
Come on, move!
Hurry up!

508
01:05:36,649 --> 01:05:40,752
Are you asleep, you bastard?
Shall I wake you up with a lash?

509
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:08,803
I haven't seen you for ages, Abdullah.

510
01:06:10,784 --> 01:06:12,105
Yes, it's been a long time.

511
01:06:13,646 --> 01:06:16,909
Still leading a nomad's life?
Still shooting?

512
01:06:18,149 --> 01:06:22,413
I got old and lazy.
Remember what I was like?

513
01:06:23,453 --> 01:06:24,914
Those were the times.

514
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:28,187
What are your men up to?

515
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:31,419
What do they want to blow up?

516
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:36,423
Some character got in there,
and won't come out.

517
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:44,859
Fyodor!
Is Petrukha with you?

518
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:49,072
They killed Petrukha, Pavel Artemyich!

519
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:50,853
Abdullah stabbed him to death.

520
01:06:56,978 --> 01:06:58,539
Pasha!

521
01:07:06,585 --> 01:07:07,606
Come on, go!

522
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:13,150
A good wife and a good home, what
else does a man need at his old age?

523
01:07:32,694 --> 01:07:34,966
I may have spent a fortune, but I got
some flour.

524
01:07:35,136 --> 01:07:37,698
I'm going to cook borscht
and make pancakes.

525
01:07:38,438 --> 01:07:40,410
At least it's some bread.

526
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:44,873
We've overstayed our time here.
As soon as the commissioner's back,

527
01:07:45,043 --> 01:07:47,705
we'll go to Astrakhan.

528
01:07:47,915 --> 01:07:51,468
It's time to tend to our son's grave.
It must've overgrown with weeds...

529
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:55,011
And we haven't been to church over
a year now. It's a great sin.

530
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:57,723
You'll wear your embroidered shirt.

531
01:07:58,653 --> 01:08:02,646
When I see you in that shirt,
I remember everything...

532
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:05,088
How we met in the infirmary
in Tsaritsyn...

533
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,461
Pasha...

534
01:08:10,702 --> 01:08:13,064
Do you remember the "Prince of
Tauride steamship?

535
01:08:17,037 --> 01:08:19,058
And what a dressing down you gave
to that staff-captain

536
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:23,401
at the fair in Kazan?

537
01:09:00,008 --> 01:09:02,120
Hey, Abdullah!

538
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,462
Haven't you got too much goods?

539
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,063
And all of it duty free?

540
01:09:07,904 --> 01:09:12,097
But there's no one at the customs.
Who should I pay duty to?

541
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:16,110
We could pay you in gold.

542
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:22,105
You know me well, Abdullah...
I never take bribes.

543
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,087
It pains me to see the state suffering.

544
01:09:25,687 --> 01:09:28,049
Aristarkh!
Settle it with the customs man.

545
01:09:51,936 --> 01:09:53,498
Fire it up!

546
01:09:59,142 --> 01:10:01,363
Wait, Abdullah!

547
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:05,406
It's me, Sayid, speaking!

548
01:10:09,049 --> 01:10:10,980
What do you mean by that?

549
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:26,822
Kill him!

550
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:03,949
Vereschagin!
Leave the boat!

551
01:11:08,593 --> 01:11:09,654
Give it back!

552
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:27,607
Wash up, guys!

553
01:12:14,111 --> 01:12:16,403
He did go! He did go after all!

554
01:12:21,476 --> 01:12:23,308
Damn him!

555
01:12:47,565 --> 01:12:48,536
Pasha!

556
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:56,702
Pasha!

557
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:05,809
Well, have you come to your senses?

558
01:13:12,884 --> 01:13:16,517
Abdullah!
The customs man has cleared it!

559
01:13:27,465 --> 01:13:28,485
Makhmud!

560
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:29,826
Fire it up!

561
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:11,287
Get to him from the back, Makhmud!

562
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:29,310
Don't let him stick his nose out.

563
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:49,825
Don't start the motor!

564
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:55,279
I'm going to get closer.

565
01:14:55,589 --> 01:14:57,751
You'll get blown up!
Stop!

566
01:15:49,799 --> 01:15:51,591
I'm here, Abdullah.

567
01:16:27,627 --> 01:16:29,598
You can come out, young ladies.

568
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:50,704
Your Honorable Excellence,
Dear Lady Luck.

569
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:55,768
Some you grace with fortune,
Others you would duck.

570
01:16:56,879 --> 01:17:00,621
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

571
01:17:01,682 --> 01:17:05,585
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

572
01:17:06,426 --> 01:17:10,649
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!

573
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:15,782
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.

574
01:17:47,886 --> 01:17:54,911
THE SUN WAS NOT UP YET

575
01:17:55,391 --> 01:17:58,334
You'd better wait, will you?
We'll get to the city together,

576
01:17:58,494 --> 01:18:00,926
and take the train from there.

577
01:18:01,456 --> 01:18:05,869
No. That's a big detour.
I'll go straight and be there sooner.

578
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:08,261
- Take a horse.
- No.

579
01:18:09,372 --> 01:18:11,523
A horse will be a nuisance.
You have to feed it.

580
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:13,034
Goodbye.

581
01:18:16,377 --> 01:18:20,250
Well? Djamilya, Zarina, Giuzel,

582
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:23,712
Sayida, Khafiza, Zukhra,

583
01:18:23,942 --> 01:18:25,934
Leyla, Zulfia.

584
01:18:30,387 --> 01:18:31,908
Goodbye, young ladies.

585
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,311
Sorry if I did something wrong.

586
01:18:45,558 --> 01:18:46,719
Thank you!

587
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:49,461
Don't mention it.

588
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,802
What about Dzhavdet?
Do you need some help?

589
01:19:05,543 --> 01:19:10,347
No, I'll deal with Dzhavdet myself.
Should you meet him, don't touch him.

590
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:15,300
Well, good luck, then.

591
01:19:30,792 --> 01:19:33,594
A good day,
a pleasant moment.

592
01:19:34,364 --> 01:19:37,496
How are you doing, my precious
Katerina Matveyevna?

593
01:19:38,437 --> 01:19:42,730
Don't judge me too harshly for
the delay. It seems to be my fate.

594
01:19:43,331 --> 01:19:46,333
But I think nothing like that
is going to happen again.

595
01:19:46,743 --> 01:19:51,897
So I hasten to inform you that I'm
alive and well, and hope you're, too.
