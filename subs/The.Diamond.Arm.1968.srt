THE DIAMOND IS ALMOST INVISIBLE

42
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,287
We bring you a live broadcast
from our sea port.

43
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,692
This snow-white liner
is to depart on its next cruise,

44
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:35,425
carrying a large contingent
of Soviet tourists

45
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,432
on a very fascinating voyage.

46
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,436
- Hello!
- Hello.

47
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,506
What is your name, please?

48
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,006
Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov.

49
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,541
- And what's your occupation?
- Senior bookkeeper.

50
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:52,310
Is there something you would like
to say to our dear listeners

51
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,750
before leaving
for this fascinating journey?

52
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,756
As a matter of fact,
I didn't want to go.

53
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,450
I was about to buy my wife
a fur coat.

54
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,597
The fur coat can wait.
It's more important to see the world.

55
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,599
He works day and night...
The fur coat can wait.

56
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,327
So you've never before...

57
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,632
No. We never travelled farther
than Dubrovka.

58
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,669
Is it your first trip abroad, too?

59
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,846
- I'm not going.
- We've come to say goodbye to dad.

60
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:26,544
Fish Street. That's an important
street there. The Chikanuk pharmacy.

61
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,981
Lyolik, I remember it all.

62
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,915
Everything you do must look very
real. You fall down and swear...

63
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,282
'Damned apple!'
No...'Damned melon!'

64
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,290
Keep that in mind!

65
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,863
The injury...
Everything should be true to life.

66
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,433
As our chief says, 'The most important
thing in our business is realism.'

67
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,532
Happy landings, tourist!

68
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,319
No, don't...
Just go!

69
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,960
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

70
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,530
- Is this Cabin 16?
- Yes, it's 16.

71
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,669
Are you bunking here, too?

72
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,771
Yes. I'm Gennady Petrovich Kozodoyev.

73
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,635
Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov.

74
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,972
- I hope we'll become friends.
- Oh, I think so.

75
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,707
- Are you bringing along souvenirs?
- No.

76
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,850
- I have some here...
- Vodka?

77

MIKHAIL SVETLOV

78
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:06,283
Day Seven
of this fascinating cruise...

79
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,683
I love the song
about hares.

80
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,757
Senya, it's not topical,
about hares!

81
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,455
'Island of Bad Luck'!

82
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,642
All covered with greenery,
Absolutely, stark,

83
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,473
Lies in our itinerary
An island of bad luck.

84
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,854
There live the savages,
Poor, wretched guys,

85
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,991
Faces bear ravages,
But kind under disguise.

86
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,562
Whatever they're doing,
It never goes right.

87
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,498
They must be born to ruin
On a very black Friday night.

88
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,143
Crocodiles not caught,
Coconuts won't grow.

89
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,712
They weep and pray to God
For days and days in a row.

90
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,620
They are no idlers,
They could have had a ball.

91
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,623
They ought to cancel Fridays
Once and for all.

92
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,195
But, alas, no calendar
On the isle, there's not!

93
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,962
Every living islander
Just goes for a naught.

94
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,703
But, alas, no calendar
On damn isle, there's not!

95
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,675
That's why poor savages,
From early morn till night,

96
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,679
Counting their damages,
Lament over their plight.

97
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,477
The poor devils moan,
Cursing their fate.

98
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,519
What year is unknown,
As is unknown the date.

99
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,677
...Finally, here is the last
port of call

100
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,975
before returning
to their motherland...

101
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:13,863
Ladies and gentlemen, we're now
in what is called the old town.

102
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,943
During the rule of the great
Emperor Shumunshin-Shah the Third,

103
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:23,675
on these heights,
the Imperial architects had built

104
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,579
a marvelous ensemble,

105
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,481
which included a palace, a mosque,

106
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,818
a 1,200-bed harem,
and many other... similar delights.

107
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,534
Have you gone crazy?

108
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,903
Something's wrong.
She wants me to go and see.

109
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,481
Hey, no, no, impossible!

110
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,845
- What does she want?
- I'll tell you later.

111
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,487
Lady, Senora, Frau, Miss,
it's out of the question.

112
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:07,217
Russo turista, capito, moralita!
Verstehen? That's it!

113
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,485
But what does she want?

114
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,997
We are most grateful to you. It was
a very interesting excursion.

115
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,814
Attention, please!
Now everyone will be on his own.

116
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,817
You can walk around the town.

117
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:40,323
But at five o'clock sharp,
everyone must be back on board.

118
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,824
See you later.

119
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,532
Guesha! Why are you leaving me
in the lurch?

120
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,396
I didn't leave you. I was waiting.

121
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,471
Let's go this way.

122
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,359
Where's he?

123
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,928
Don't worry,
he'll come.

124
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,793
- The password is 'Damned melon'?
- Damned melon.

125
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,373
Are you sure he's on the SS
'Mikhail Svetlov'?

126
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,239
We were assured that he was.

127
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,377
The ship is leaving in an hour!

128
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,816
Shut up!

129
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,457
Sorry, I guess I lost my temper.

130
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,550
You know...

131
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,986
Guesha!

132
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:22,978
Excuse me, Miss...

133
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,797
Damned melon!

134
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,235
Damned melon!

135
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,682
- Russo?
- Yes.

136
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,441
- 'Mikhail Svetlov'?
- Yes, yes.

137
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,455
Damned melon.
Damned melon...

138
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,767
What's wrong with him?

139
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,964
It's a very bad sprain.
He's even lost consciousness.

140
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:14,973
Let's get down to work.

141
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,850
Damned melon! .

142
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,857
'Mikhail Svetlov'...

143
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,817
Damned melon!

144
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,626
Damned melon!

145
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,348
Russo?
'Mikhail Svetlov'?

146
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,850
Why didn't you use your brains?

147
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,215
But the other one gave the password
too. 'Damned melon'.

148
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,861
There follows an untranslatable play
on words

149
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,293
with the use of local idiomatic
expressions.

150
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,928
Comrades, it's time!
The ship leaves in half an hour!

151
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,821
Those idiots claimed
he was unconscious.

152
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,828
So the poor fool has no idea
what's going on.

153
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,966
That's perfect!

154
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,475
What's this?

155
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,484
Nothing. Just contraband items
someone's trying to smuggle in.

156
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,847
Don't worry.
Calm down... Drink some of this.

157
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,718
I never touch the stuff.

158
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,660
Haven't you read about it in 'House
and Home'? Doctors recommend it.

159
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,232
It will calm your nervous system
and soothe your arteries.

160
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,671
Drink up.

161
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,842
Captain,
what do I do now?

162
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,504
Nothing.
Just have fun and relax.

163
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,675
But don't breathe a word to anyone
about that contraband stuff.

164
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,820
And if someone wants to know
what happened to my arm?

165
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,823
Say you slipped, fell down
and got a closed fracture.

166
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,018
You were knocked out, and when you
came to, it was already in a cast.

167
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,826
I slipped, fell down,
a closed fracture.

168
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,798
I was knocked out,
I came to-a plaster cast.

169
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,531
And don't worry,
I'll notify everyone concerned.

170
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:43,975
Thank you very much.

171
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,275
Don't you remember a thing?

172
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,976
Be careful!

173
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,913
- Why? I remember very well.
- You remember what?

174
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,722
I slipped...
got knocked out.

175
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,483
When I came to, I had this cast.
That's all!

176
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,725
- I wish I fell instead of you.
- Thanks. That's nice of you, Guesha.

177
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,227
Please, take care of your arm, Senya.

178
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,662
Nadia is going to be upset.

179
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,862
'That's c'est la vie,'
as Frenchmen say.

180
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,704
I'm sorry, friend!

181
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,348
Are you finished? Must I go already?

182
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,212
Yes, move along, you're in the way.

183
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,654
- You're through with me?
- That's right.

184
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,988
Could it be that the Captain didn't
notify the customs? What do I do now?

185
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,832
There he is! The stuff is safe.
As safe as in a safe.

186
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,302
And the key?

187
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,840
To quote our chief's immortal words,
'Once a halfwit always a halfwit.'

188
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,674
- I don't get it.
- You'll get it. Let's go to the chief!

189
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,757
Hands off me!

190
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,854
- Where are we going?
- Home.

191
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,561
So you had a look at some foreign
ports?

192
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,894
Yes, foreign ports.

193
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,867
Where should I go?
To the police? Or home?

194
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,501
This is the way home.

195
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,435
I didn't give him my address.
Where's he taking me?

196
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,939
There's just one road here
that goes into the city.

197
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,744
I want to go to Morskaya Street,
number 21, apartment 9.

198
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,884
entrance three, third floor.

199
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,817
What's wrong with your arm?

200
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:47,687
Why is he interested in my arm?
He looks suspicious.

201
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,720
I slipped, fell down, got knocked out,
came to already in a cast.

202
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,024
Excuse me, you're an amateur actor,
aren't you?

203
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,467
Yes, that's right.

204
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,536
Why did I lie to him?
Why did he ask me?

205
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,901
He's trying to get information from
me. He looks more and more suspicious.

206
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,670
Why did he turn there?
He should have kept going straight.

207
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,643
The highway's blocked for repairs.
We should make a detour.

208
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,409
- Stop! Let's give them a lift!
- I can't. It's against regulations.

209
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,987
He didn't pick up those girls.
He's not a taxi driver. He's a bandit.

210
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,284
Why did you wait to tell him
who you were?

211
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,226
I wanted to check
if he's really fit for the job.

212
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,298
Did he prove it?

213
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,992
He proved it, Colonel.
He's perfect!

214
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,765
I never dreamed that he'd...

215
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,907
Hit you with the cast?

216
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,573
Yes, sir!
I probably should have...

217
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,938
No sense in it.
Does he agree?

218
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,679
He agrees.
But still, I think we might...

219
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:44,816
No sense in it.

220
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,575
- May I suggest...
- You may not!

221
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,219
- Maybe you'll let me...
- Yes, do that.

222
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,323
This operation is your baby.
Act as you see right.

223
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,689
Now go on with your report.

224
00:24:54,993 --> 00:25:00,898
Yes, sir. When we became better
acquainted, I outlined our plan...

225
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,826
What do I do now?

226
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,970
Nothing. Live as usual.
They're going to bite the bait.

227
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,534
They'll be watching you,
we'll be watching them.

228
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,471
As soon as they try to get the cast,
we'll close the trap.

229
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,769
Like I'm the live bait.
I know, I'm a fisherman myself.

230
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,347
They might offer to pay a ransom,
but I can bargain too.

231
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,715
I don't think so. They're convinced
you don't know a thing.

232
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:27,348
They'll want their goods back, without
paying and without your noticing.

233
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,417
How can they take a plaster cast off
without my noticing?

234
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:35,862
I'm not sure how they'll try to do it,
but they can get you drunk,

235
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,298
drug you or knock you out.

236
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,735
It's no problem to do it on someone
who's knocked out or even dead.

237
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,306
Who's dead?

238
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,703
But I don't really think
it'll go that far.

239
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,549
Couldn't you let someone else

240
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,514
wear this plaster cast
for a little while?

241
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,583
Well, you can always say no.

242
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,624
No, I'm no coward,
I'm just afraid.

243
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,155
Afraid I won't be able to do it.

244
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,800
Every man can do many things,

245
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,270
but, sadly enough,
not everyone is aware of it.

246
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,465
That's right, it happens so often.

247
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,337
Let's set up the liaison.

248
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,214
Now what are you doing,
Semyon Semyonovich?

249
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:36,421
How are we going to organize it?
In case we must speak to you...

250
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,823
Come to my place.

251
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,258
And when you must speak to us...

252
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,796
I'll call a taxi and give my name.

253
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,231
Then I'll come, or maybe my assistant.
Everything clear?

254
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,841
Thanks very, very much.
And I'm sorry I was so...

255
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,444
Forget it, we've seen much worse.

256
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,505
Won't you come up
and meet my wife?

257
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:02,185
We've already agreed,
nobody must know about this.

258
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,647
- Not even Nadia?
- No one.

259
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,791
I understand.

260
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,624
Semyon Semyonovich!
Your bags...

261
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,637
Senya, the door.

262
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,413
Welcome back, Semyon Semyonovich!

263
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,347
Sorry that I'm so late.

264
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,551
But my social work comes first.

265
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,656
What's wrong with your arm?

266
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,530
On Wednesday you're giving a lecture.

267
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,294
We've put up the posters.

268
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:57,570
You're the only one from our
community who has ever been there.

269
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,006
The subject is
'New York, City of Contrasts'.

270
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,180
I haven't been to New York,
I've been to Istanbul.

271
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,318
'Istanbul, City of Contrasts'.
What difference does it make?

272
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,713
But what about your arm?

273
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,822
A closed fracture. I was knocked out.
When I came to, I had this cast on.

274
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,459
So unpretentious, but in good taste.

275
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,624
That's really nice!

276
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,760
Oh yes, so what's it about your arm?

277
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,904
That's for you. A souvenir.

278
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,332
Thank you, Semyon Semyonovich!

279
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,410
Just press the button.

280
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,977
- Isn't it funny?
- Very funny.

281
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,554
Thanks.

282
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,655
Did you see Sophia Loren?

283
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,324
Did you drink Coca-Cola?

284
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:57,992
How does it taste?

285
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,261
Go to sleep.

286
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,297
Doctors recommend it.
It'll help me sleep.

287
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,370
I read it
in the 'House and Home' magazine.

288
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,440
Tell me exactly
what did you do to your arm?

289
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,508
I slipped, I fell down,
and got a closed fracture.

290
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,515
I knocked myself out,
when I came to I had this cast on.

291
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:27,386
I heard all that already. Please tell me
the truth, horrible as it may be.

292
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,457
I walked in the street and I slipped...

293
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,698
You never knew how to lie, did you?

294
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,036
I know what happened.

295
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,770
Who told you?

296
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,602
I'm sure it's not a closed fracture.

297
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,374
What have you got there?

298
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,546
Gold and diamonds.

299
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,853
Stop kidding!

300
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:04,557
You haven't got a closed fracture.
You got a compound fracture!

301
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,728
Let's go to bed now.

302
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,472
You should be killed for that!

303
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,679
Please don't beat me!
I'll fix everything!

304
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,478
I want to see you dead!

305
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:12,486
I want to see you in your grave,
with a shroud around you!

306
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:19,661
I want to see you living only
on your salary!

307
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:29,497
Victor, can't you read?

308
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,231
'Dogs walking not allowed!'

309
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,235
Mommy, look!

310
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,677
Oh, get down from there!

311
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,519
Our lawns aren't made to walk on!

312
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,883
- Then what are they made for?
- Their aesthetic beauty!

313
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,583
Then where can I walk him?

314
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,818
You can walk him in your flat!

315
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,829
What is this?
Good morning!

316
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,527
I've been to London.
There, dogs walk anywhere they want.

317
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,629
Dog is man's best friend.

318
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,906
It may be in London
that dog is man's best friend,

319
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,615
but here, man's best friend
is the superintendent.

320
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,329
Treasure handed to government

321
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,774
Old man!

322
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,311
Have you got a light?

323
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,254
- What? You deaf and dumb?
- Right!

324
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,020
I thought so...

325
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:05,969
There he is!

326
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,403
He's an idiot.

327
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,347
There's no problem.
We'll trap him! It'll be easy.

328
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:22,479
Invite him to go fishing
at the Black Stones.

329
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,850
Like we agreed.
And arrange to spend the night there.

330
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,786
Only do things right.

331
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,486
Like give flowers to his old lady,
and ice-cream to both brats.

332
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,561
If only you can remember all that,
Lord Nelson!

333
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,447
You lamebrain! The ice-cream's
for the brats!

334
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,766
Oh, my eye? It's nothing,
it's getting better.

335
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,536
Senya, how's your arm?
No pain?

336
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,207
Can you move your fingers?
No, no, the other arm.

337
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,911
Good, you'll be okay.

338
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,215
You're his friend.
Please, use your influence.

339
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,479
He doesn't take his arm seriously.

340
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,417
You know what's wrong with daddy's
arm? It's not what he tells everybody.

341
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,326
And what is it?

342
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,998
He's got a compound fracture,
not a closed one.

343
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,570
Now go to your mama.

344
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:50,238
Senya, let's go trout fishing with me.

345
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:54,572
To the Black Stones. We'll rent
a boat and spend the night there, huh?

346
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:05,446
No, not for the night.
My arm might catch cold.

347
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:10,759
- Let's go in the morning.
- Anything you say.

348
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,452
- So, at the crack of dawn then?
- Right!

349
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,594
What are you doing?!

350
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,331
Put down the gun
and apologize this very minute!

351
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,972
Such a charming child!

352
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,415
Our fashions were created by

353
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,314
designer Margarita Semyonova,

354
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,489
architect Rogal Levitskaya,

355
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,252
chief designer
Albert Mudrik.

356
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:48,722
Here is our summer combination
outfit 'Universal-69',

357
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,491
which earned a prize of encouragement

358
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,432
at the regional modern garment forum
in Zhitomir.

359
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,873
The original feature of this model

360
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,871
being that you can very easily
change the coat into a jacket.

361
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,679
But that's not all!

362
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,680
With just a twist of your wrist,

363
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,956
your trousers are changed...

364
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,960
your trousers are changed...

365
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,258
the trousers are changed...

366
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,599
to elegantly looking shorts.

367
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:29,530
You will forgive us the delay
due to a technical incident.

368
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,707
And finally, we present our latest
model,

369
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,776
a beach ensemble

370
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,407
'Mini-bikini-69'.

371
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,931
Why is the chief here?

372
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,171
The plan's been changed. You'll pull
off the operation at White Rock.

373
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,865
- Why?
- Not such a big crowd there.

374
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,301
They don't bite at White Rock!

375
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:12,381
They'll bite so well that our customer
will forget about everything.

376
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,313
Is all the rest according to the plan?

377
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,943
Everything's the same otherwise.
You'll knock him out a little...

378
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,821
You know, that's not artistic.

379
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,892
But it's cheap and very practical.

380
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,321
Chip off the plaster and we split.

381
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,725
What about my alibi?

382
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:32,801
Try and get marks of violence
on your face.

383
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,664
But I'm begging you to...

384
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,704
Don't you worry, Kozlodoyev.

385
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,340
Kozodoyev!

386
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,333
Kozlodoyev!

387
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,975
I'll bash you real carefully,
but hard.

388
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,475
Good evening.

389
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,619
Where are you going so late at night?

390
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,951
I'm going fishing early in the morning,
and I forgot to go to the baker's.

391
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,283
There's one open
at the other end of town.

392
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,384
Poor guy!

393
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,762
To think that it should've been me.

394
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,455
Get drunk and it'll be you.

395
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,526
Let's load him on.

396
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,043
Good evening, Semyon Semyonovich!

397
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,909
But I don't know you.

398
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,418
- Call me Volodya.
- Senya.

399
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,349
I bring you greetings from
Mikhail Ivanovich.

400
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,989
He wants to see you urgently.

401
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,565
- When?
- Why not now?

402
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,695
Then I'll be late to buy bread.

403
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,666
Don't worry, I've got my car.

404
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,508
Well, thanks very much, Volodya.
Good night.

405
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,976
I wish you a good fishing trip.

406
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,509
You're sure you'll be going
to the Black Stones?

407
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,843
Yes.

408
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,849
Good night then!

409
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,655
Our tenants don't go to the baker's
in a taxi.

410
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,498
I guess this is it.
Or maybe...

411
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,566
We shouldn't have come here.
The fish bite better at Black Stones.

412
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,831
They're going to bite so well here
that you'll forget about everything.

413
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,197
Help!

414
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,204
Help me!

415
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,401
SOS!

416
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,552
Lyolik!

417
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,625
Idiot!

418
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,466
Mama! I'm going to die!

419
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,861
Lyolik!

420
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,403
Help!

421
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,340
Mama!

422
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,467
- Why are you yelling like that?
- Don't interfere, boy!

423
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:37,555
Let's pray to our Lord...

424
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,780
Get out of my way, milksop!
Get out of here!

425
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,864
There go ducks flying...

426
00:47:55,706 --> 00:48:00,234
As well as two geese...

427
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,744
The chief's giving us a big chance
to make it up to him.

428
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,610
The place for this new operation
under the code name ' wild duck'...

429
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,651
will be a restaurant called
'The Weeping Willow Tree'.

430
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:21,960
Straight north of the building,
about a hundred yards off,

431
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,593
there're toilettes of a john kind...

432
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,908
which are designated on the map
by the letters 'M' and 'W'.

433
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:39,848
The path leading to the toilettes
goes by a spruce tree,

434
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,281
where I will be.

435
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,914
That'll be our stationing.

436
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:49,356
Your mission is to invite the customer
to the restaurant for dinner,

437
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,989
then bring him to the right condition
until he wants... to wash up.

438
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,490
After you show him the way,

439
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:02,765
you immediately regain
your original position.

440
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,805
You've got an alibi
no one will challenge,

441
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:08,502
while our customer, passing by the
spruce tree, gets into my hands.

442
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,608
Everything that follows is just
a matter of expertise.

443
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,876
But how am I going to bring him to
the right condition? He doesn't drink.

444
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,515
To quote our chief,
'When there's a sucker who pays

445
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,680
you'll see teetotalers drink,
including those who have ulcers.'

446
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,199
With just a salary to live on,
you can't take taxis!

447
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,968
Give me a hundred tickets.

448
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,913
If you buy them, just imagine,
you can win...

449
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,408
A fire engine!

450
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:51,782
Stop your advertising. I'm not buying
tickets to win.

451
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,856
Peddle these tickets
to our tenants.

452
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,726
If they won't buy,
I'll cut off their gas.

453
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,726
Is everything perfectly clear?

454
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,997
Hang around all the markets,

455
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,363
and the free exchange stores.
Be seen in the restaurants.

456
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,573
Let people see you as much as you can.

457
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:19,010
Here, for your expenses.

458
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,543
No, no, I wouldn't think of it!

459
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:25,245
Please, no initiative.
Take it, it's five hundred rubles.

460
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:27,947
In the new denomination?

461
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:53,575
- Something wrong with your head?
- I hid the cash.

462
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,810
- Come on, Semyon Semyonovich...
- I got it.

463
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:58,946
And take this.

464
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:03,982
What's that for?

465
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,993
You can never tell.

466
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,200
I haven't had it in my hands
since the war.

467
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,237
It's not a real gun,
it's rather psychological.

468
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:23,779
You can use it to scare someone.
We loaded it with blanks.

469
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:28,683
Can't I have a real one?
You can never tell.

470
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,444
- No, you'd better not.
- I see.

471
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,216
Semyon Semyonovich,
what's the matter with you?

472
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:55,937
That's how it should be.

473
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,440
The Weeping Willow Tree Restaurant

474
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,651
Fedya, we'd like to have also...
a wild duck.

475
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:09,850
No problem.

476
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,927
- What are we going to drink?
- Beer for me, huh?

477
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:17,624
A bottle of vodka and a bottle of
cognac. And two bottles of beer.

478
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,002
Oh, I forgot to call my mother.
One second...

479
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:31,937
Good evening!
I told Fedya to bring a wild duck.

480
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,208
I hope you have some?

481
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,015
Lyolik, I'm waiting.

482
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,250
Soon our customer will be ripe.

483
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,687
I saw the chief. He's here.

484
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,311
- Is this one taken?
- Yes, sorry.

485
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,655
That's it. Here we go again.

486
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,357
Keep calm.
And don't sit there. Act.

487
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,370
Excuse me, where's the telephone?

488
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,672
Thanks.

489
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,300
This is Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov.

490
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,872
Please send a taxi to the Weeping
Willow Restaurant.

491
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,377
It's urgent.

492
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,013
Well, shall we start?

493
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,815
No, no, I've got my beer.

494
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,964
He's watching me.
Let him see that I'm drinking.

495
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,208
- Here's to your bonus.
- And may it not be the last one.

496
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,347
After the first drink, one never eats.

497
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,516
Let's drink some vodka to your health!

498
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,426
All right.

499
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:40,876
Have a chaser.

500
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:50,245
I'll bet that if anyone of you
had found a treasure,

501
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,887
you would have done exactly
like I did.

502
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,586
What are you going to do
with your reward?

503
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:57,020
For the money that the state
has to pay me by law...

504
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,592
on my friends' advice,

505
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,822
I'm going to buy a Moskvitch car.

506
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,895
The very latest model!

507
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:09,405
One second.

508
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,968
The customer is nearly ripe.
You better get ready!

509
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,543
I'm always ready!
You idiot!

510
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,662
- What do you want?
- To see you, pal.

511
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:44,196
- Don't you recognize me?
- I don't think so.

512
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,933
- Let's have a drink.
- Why not?

513
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,258
I didn't recognize you right away
either.

514
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,185
Why did you shave your mustache?

515
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,389
I said, why did you shave off
your mustache, dumbbell?

516
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:13,963
Whose mustache?

517
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:20,642
- To whom have I the honor?
- I went to school with this dumbbell.

518
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,778
Why did Volodya shave his mustache?

519
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:28,847
Senya, hurry up and tell the comrade
why Volodya shaved his mustache.

520
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,645
We've got very little time.

521
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,870
Sorry, I'm mistaken.

522
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,998
If you'd had a mustache, you'd be
the double of Volodya Trynkin.

523
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:58,872
- At what time does your plane leave?
- Yes, the plane...

524
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,380
If you get a chance to go to Siberia...

525
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,381
If you get a chance to go to Siberia,
you'll be very welcome.

526
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,519
Why don't you better come to see us?

527
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:09,692
See you around.

528
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:16,964
I'm glad he's not the smuggler.
He looks like a likable guy.

529
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,394
Why did I drink all that stuff?

530
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,768
Senya, are you in the right condition?

531
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,405
- What condition?
- The right one?

532
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:30,846
No!

533
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:33,847
- In that case, one more drink...
- No!

534
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:34,984
You must!

535
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:39,651
Senya, do you respect me?

536
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,225
I do, but I'm through.

537
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,485
- Then I'm going to bite you.
- Go ahead.

538
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,498
Guesha, people are staring.

539
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,877
- Will you drink with the duck?
- Why not?

540
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:06,509
- Fedya, the duck!
- The duck!

541
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,882
- Is that a duck?
- That's a duck!

542
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,356
They don't drink vodka with duck.

543
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:22,832
We must drink...

544
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,692
I get you. Fedya, champagne!

545
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:28,961
- Here's to you.
- Thanks.

546
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,335
Perhaps you wish to wash up a bit?

547
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,938
You heard what he said?
Time to wash up! Let's go.

548
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:41,512
- And the duck?
- It won't fly away. It's cooked.

549
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,877
Behave yourself... Hurry up!

550
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,188
Straight north of the place,
about a hundred yard walk.

551
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,757
Now what?

552
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:53,762
Senya!

553
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,236
Song about the hares!

554
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,177
In the heart of the woods

555
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,783
Where leaves twirl in flight,

556
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:19,312
Where age-old oaks
Loom like wizardly gods,

557
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,815
Hares mowed the grass
In a grove at midnight,

558
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:28,661
And they sang a strange song
With the following words:

559
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:34,269
We couldn't care less,
We couldn't care less,

560
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,962
Though owls and wolves
Make us real wuss.

561
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:40,976
We've got a job to do

562
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,311
At this hour of voodoo,

563
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:46,971
We're mowing the grass,
A truly magic grass.

564
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:52,545
And the wizardly oaks
Whisper something in darkness.

565
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:57,258
By the stench-soaked bogs,
Shadows loom in the rain.

566
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:01,624
Hares mow their grass,
Feeling lost, feeling luckless,

567
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:06,559
And out of fright
Hasten their refrain:

568
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:11,438
We couldn't care less,
We couldn't care less,

569
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,368
Though owls and wolves
Make us real wuss.

570
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:20,004
We've got a job to do
At this hour of voodoo,

571
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,814
We're mowing the grass,
A truly magic grass.

572
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,254
We couldn't care less,
We couldn't care less,

573
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,587
We firmly believe
In the saying of the past,

574
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:33,829
That bold'll be the one

575
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:35,757
Who thrice this has done:

576
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,523
At the hour of voodoo

577
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,894
Mowed magic grass.

578
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:42,765
We couldn't care less,
We couldn't care less,

579
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,874
Bolder we'll be
Than the lion, king of beast!

580
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:49,676
We'll hold out once,
We won't screw this chance,

581
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:52,815
And no evil thing
Will ruffle us in the least!

582
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,227
We couldn't care less,
We couldn't care less,

583
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,227
Bolder we'll be
Than the lion, king of beast!

584
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,630
We'll hold out once,
We won't screw this chance,

585
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,866
And no evil thing
Will ruffle us in the least!

586
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,229
Something has to be done.

587
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:51,270
We won't put up with drunkenness!

588
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,405
But you know very well,
Varvara Sergeyevna, that...

589
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:58,274
I know a lot more than you do,
my dear. Where did he get the money?

590
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,277
He was invited by a friend
who had gotten a bonus.

591
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:04,849
According to police records,
just for one bay window he broke

592
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,387
he paid ninety seven rubles
and eighteen kopecks.

593
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,525
Where did he get that kind of money?

594
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,820
Your husband has changed
since that cruise.

595
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,657
The corruptive Western influence.

596
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,867
Those idiotic toys.

597
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,870
And the thing he said about dogs.
'The best friend of man.'

598
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,435
It's odd,
and this is only an understatement.

599
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,436
All those elements of 'la dolce vita'!

600
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,513
I wouldn't be surprised to hear

601
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:38,985
that your husband's secretly
seeing a mistress.

602
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,289
What?!

603
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,879
- Is this yours?
- Mine.

604
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,784
- And where did you get it?
- You know where.

605
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,785
That cruise, huh?

606
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,792
He's been enrolled in a spy ring!

607
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:57,791
How could he do that?

608
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,333
He's so naive.

609
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:06,836
His arm... They tortured him!
Why didn't I think of it before?

610
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,306
Oh, my God!

611
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,973
We couldn't care less...

612
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:18,343
What am I going to do?
And what happens to the children?

613
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,483
Such a disgrace!

614
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,793
There's only one way out.

615
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,462
Just one way out...

616
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,363
Just one.

617
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,371
Enough!

618
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:51,616
Only aristocrats and degenerates
drink champagne in the morning.

619
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,222
We're going to see the chief
right now!

620
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,703
I can't go in my condition.

621
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:14,167
I need to take a bath at least,

622
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,474
and a cup of coffee.

623
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,877
You'll get your bath all right there,
and coffee, too.

624
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:23,413
Even some cocoa with tea!
Let's go!

625
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,551
Let's go, Guesha.

626
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,343
Nadia! Nadia, honey!

627
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:55,677
Senya, calm down.

628
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:58,819
There's a way out.

629
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,487
You must go to the police
and tell them everything.

630
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,960
- About what?
- Your treason.

631
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:11,622
SHAME ON THE DRUNKARD AND
DEBAUCHER S.S. GORBUNKOV!

632
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,208
How could you possibly imagine that?

633
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,278
You, my wife,
mother of my children!

634
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,278
Oh no! Not that!

635
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,417
How else could I possibly explain it?

636
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:30,552
You could imagine anything,
but not that!

637
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,880
Oh, this is the end!

638
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,916
Where did you get that gun
and that money?

639
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,658
Shut up, you wretched soul!
Shut up!

640
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,801
Senya, tell me, where did you get
that pistol and that money?

641
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,871
I beg you, please tell me!

642
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,734
All right, I will tell you.
But don't say a word to anyone!

643
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:54,876
I swear.

644
01:06:58,414 --> 01:06:59,813
It's a state secret.

645
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:04,317
That money and that gun were given me
to help me with my mission.

646
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,823
- What mission?
- Sorry, I can't tell you that.

647
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,458
When the time comes,
you'll know everything.

648
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:15,528
You might even... get a reward...

649
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,392
After I'm gone!

650
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,704
That's a marvelous plan, chief!

651
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,703
At twelve o'clock it will be ready
to roll.

652
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:31,737
A genius!

653
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,722
Good morning.

654
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,896
- Good morning.
- Bon jour, Madame.

655
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:04,242
I'm enchanted to welcome you
in this modest, but rather cozy...

656
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,379
Salut, wonder boy!

657
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,810
The chief sent me.

658
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:12,613
Everything is ready.

659
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,715
- The papers?
- The passport is right here.

660
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,954
- Which joint?
- Hotel Atlantic.

661
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,323
A nice double room, all prepaid.

662
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:31,465
- The guy?
- Front view. Profile.

663
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,702
The fee?

664
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,472
An advance, for starters.

665
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,756
One pill will be enough.

666
01:08:56,031 --> 01:09:01,435
Excuse me, haven't you got the same
thing, but without the wings?

667
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:02,662
No, sorry, we haven't.

668
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,601
Well, I'll look around.

669
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:13,506
Haven't you got something like this,
but with mother-of-pearl buttons?

670
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:14,944
No, sorry, we haven't any.

671
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:16,840
Well, I'll have a look around.

672
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,768
- Who, me?
- Yes.

673
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:39,268
Excuse me.
I overheard you...

674
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:44,469
I've got what you're looking for,
with the mother-of-pearl buttons.

675
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:46,642
Only it's in my suitcase at the hotel.

676
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,646
- Do you need it badly?
- Yes.

677
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,542
Then I'll give you my address.

678
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,654
Hotel Atlantic.
It's not far from here.

679
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,998
Will nine o'clock be convenient
for you?

680
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,661
All right then.

681
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:11,002
Here you are. I'll be looking forward
to seeing you.

682
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:22,746
Nine sharp. Hotel Atlantic.
Room 327. Anna Sergeyevna.

683
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,443
I have a gut feeling
it's a real fish this time.

684
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,814
What does she look like?

685
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,460
I see.

686
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,658
Keep on your toes. I expect a better
show from you than last night.

687
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,533
I don't drink at all.
A friend invited me.

688
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,760
By the way, how is he
after last night?

689
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:42,961
I don't know, he didn't phone.

690
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,531
All right, go to the hotel
and act depending on the situation.

691
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,678
There might be accomplices there,
check it out.

692
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:50,834
Is your gun with you?

693
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:54,616
The psychic one.

694
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,717
We'll hear your signal.
The note, please.

695
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,484
Chanel, number five.

696
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:05,794
I'll be seeing you!

697
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,468
Where are you going?
Ah, your mission.

698
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,702
- Be careful!
- I'll be all right.

699
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:09,224
I'll be back soon.

700
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,342
Hotel Atlantic

701
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,382
- The customer's here.
- Perfect.

702
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,226
Hello, Five? He just went in.

703
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,455
Roger. Out.

704
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:09,478
Hotel Atlantic. Room 327.
Anna Sergeyevna. Nine o'clock.

705
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,652
Come in!

706
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:33,732
At last!

707
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,571
Good evening.
Have a seat. I'll be right with you.

708
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:57,832
What are you up to?

709
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,465
What's the matter?

710
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:03,538
My cuff link. It rolled under there.

711
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,701
Here, it came off.

712
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,310
You nearly frightened me to death.

713
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,770
Let me help you.

714
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:17,511
I thought something had really gone
wrong.

715
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,851
See, my heart's thumping like crazy.

716
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:21,446
Feel it.

717
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,759
Feel it.

718
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,720
I feel it.

719
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:32,364
As soon as he's asleep,
she'll turn out the lights.

720
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,365
What if he leaves?

721
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:38,233
- Could you leave a girl like that?
- But he's a faithful husband.

722
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,375
There is no husband

723
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,511
who has not longed to be a bachelor
at least for an hour.

724
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,675
Look out for the signal!

725
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:18,713
How about that gown?

726
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:24,275
A friend's going to bring it
in a minute or two.

727
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,988
- Do you mind waiting?
- No, I don't mind.

728
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:33,986
In the meantime, would you like
some wine?

729
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:39,559
I'd rather have... beer.

730
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,795
I only have wine.

731
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,416
Here's to our chance encounter.

732
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,823
Come on, drink!

733
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,799
What's keeping your friend?
Maybe, I'll come back another time?

734
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:54,806
Who cares about her anyway?

735
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,945
My gown is as good as hers.

736
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:01,174
Let me show you.

737
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:41,539
It's not my fault, I swear!

738
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,709
He came here on his own!

739
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,824
I saw your special mission.

740
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:31,693
After such a monstrous lie,
I will not stay with you any longer!

741
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,637
I'm sure the children will understand
when they grow up.

742
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,268
I'll take care of the divorce
formalities. Goodbye.

743
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,311
Good morning.

744
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,496
I've got to leave right now
for Dubrovka.

745
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:03,494
Right! But not now.

746
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:08,225
Tomorrow we'll send you a taxi.
Will eight o'clock be all right?

747
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:09,665
But why not today?

748
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,500
Today we'll need your help.

749
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,503
We want you
to meet your friend.

750
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,381
The one you took a fishing trip with.
The man who invited you to dinner.

751
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:21,516
Ah, Gennady Petrovich...

752
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:25,016
You'll see him
and tell him casually

753
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:28,015
that at eight o'clock tomorrow,
you plan to go out to Dubrovka.

754
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,517
And, most importantly,
you'll tell him, also casually,

755
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:35,828
that the cast's coming off your arm
the day after tomorrow.

756
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,891
- Is it Guesha?
- Yes.

757
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,464
Then why haven't you...

758
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:45,697
We didn't want to scare off
a more important fish.

759
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:59,253
ANNOUNCING COMRADELY TRIAL

760
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:02,322
OF THE DEBAUCHER AND
DRUNKARD S.S. GORBUNKOV

761
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:07,660
- You sing beautifully!
- Oh, come on...

762
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:11,854
Have you known citizen Gorbunkov
for long?

763
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,796
Yes, ten years, sorry to say.

764
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:18,668
So for ten years he hit the bottle,
debauched and led an immoral life?

765
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,367
For ten years he has very cleverly
masked himself

766
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,808
as a decent person.
I didn't trust him, though.

767
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,948
Don't you think we must always
trust people?

768
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:30,251
I don't think
you can ever trust a man

769
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,680
except in the most extreme cases.

770
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,320
- That's really your opinion?
- Yes.

771
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:37,255
Listen... who are you anyway?

772
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:41,690
I work with him.
Say, he's a colleague.

773
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,759
I see. Booze partner.

774
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:50,029
You get out of here!

775
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:53,965
As you say among yourselves,
back to your cage!

776
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:57,767
All right, but just one question.
Did you use good glue to put it up?

777
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,406
Don't worry, lush,
you can't rip it off!

778
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,640
Now take it off, please.

779
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:05,351
Chief, we're done for.

780
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,279
The cast is going to be removed,
the customer's leaving...

781
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,286
I'll kill him! .

782
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:23,800
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

783
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:25,567
To see my family at Dubrovka.

784
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,467
Did you call for a taxi
to go to Dubrovka?

785
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:31,812
Yes, I did.

786
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,474
Get in.

787
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,875
- Goodbye.
- Have a nice trip.

788
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,534
Why didn't Mikhail Ivanovich
come?

789
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,634
And Volodya?

790
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,273
Are they busy?

791
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,349
- What is your rank?
- What rank?

792
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:11,849
Are you like Volodya,
a lieutenant in the police?

793
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:18,319
A lieutenant... First Lieutenant...

794
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:23,657
May l, to impress my wife,
call you that?

795
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,398
Comrade First Lieutenant?

796
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:29,497
- Is it all right if I do?
- Yeah, sure.

797
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:32,673
And please be sure to tell her

798
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:36,800
that you put me on a special mission
that evening at the hotel.

799
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,376
And for her not to get worried,
just keep quiet

800
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:45,447
about smugglers,
diamonds and gold.

801
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,748
Keep quiet? It can't be done.

802
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:54,890
I have to consult about it
with the chief... with those above me.

803
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:58,032
- With Mikhail Ivanovich?
- Yes, with Mikhail Ivanovich.

804
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,469
Give him my best regards.

805
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,966
Hello? Chief? It's me...

806
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,708
Chief, this is me, Lyolik!

807
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,215
He took off for Dubrovka
twenty minutes ago.

808
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:20,285
In a taxi. It was a beige 'Volga'.
The number was 28-70 OGO.

809
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,555
Roger. I got it.

810
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,291
Guesha is nineteen kilometers out.

811
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:31,261
To hell with him anyhow. Roger.

812
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,658
We're going by a new operational
plan,

813
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,996
keeping a low profile.

814
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:49,350
Mikhail Ivanovich sends his regards.

815
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,685
Everything's going to be all right,
and even better.

816
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:58,315
Your old lady will get you fit as
a fiddle, without a cast.

817
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,155
Mikhail Ivanovich has ordered
the cast removed today.

818
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,159
- You've caught him?
- You bet we have.

819
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:05,731
- And who is it?
- Some dimwit.

820
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:14,265
Why go back to your place?
No point in wasting time.

821
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,967
We've got a spot by the road
where we can knock the cast off.

822
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:19,912
To quote our dear chief...
Mikhail Ivanovich,

823
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:22,614
you've got to strike the iron
when you're close to the swag.

824
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:29,417
We're going to reduce it to shreds
and get at every stone and coin in it.

825
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:33,523
Could you please take inventory
and make a list of everything?

826
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:35,219
Sure, we're going to do it all legal,

827
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:38,661
with receipts and everything.
We'll even take your finger prints.

828
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,712
Our operation will take at most
about fifteen minutes.

829
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:32,410
Soften down the plaster
while I pick all the stuff up.

830
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:34,355
Lots of work.

831
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,490
Gee, you've got everything it takes,
haven't you?

832
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:38,421
We've got to scarper.

833
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:44,554
The chief just gave me the order
to find another pad.

834
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:46,433
So we move out of here.

835
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,763
Your mustache... one side has come off.

836
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:54,875
Thanks.

837
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:56,810
Hands up!

838
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:09,944
Copter Seven, what do you see
on the road? Will you report?

839
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:13,752
All I see is a milk truck

840
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,253
going towards town.

841
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:20,683
No sign of any taxi.
Am keeping on observing.

842
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,475
End of Part One

843
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,711
MOSFILM

844
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:52,224
THE DIAMOND ARM

845
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,396
A screen novel in two parts
from the life of smugglers,

846
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:56,928
with prologue and epilogue.

847
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:58,493
Synopsis of Part One.

848
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:04,672
Part Two

849
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,898
THE BONY LEG

850
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,665
No beige taxi
ever entered Dubrovka.

851
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:10,497
Will you inspect Quadrangle 45!

852
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:19,239
Stop!

853
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:23,214
Stop! Wait!

854
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,521
- Could you take me to town please?
- What's up?

855
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:35,962
It's a top secret affair of State!

856
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:40,324
- All right, climb in.
- You've got to hurry!

857
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:41,832
I'm just learning to drive,
don't you see?

858
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:42,970
We're short of time!

859
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:46,967
Time is money.
When you see money, don't lose time.

860
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,610
We must strike the iron
when we're close to the swag.

861
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:53,611
Hands up!

862
01:30:54,315 --> 01:30:55,907
Both of you! Or this thing
will go off!

863
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:14,291
They did it all for nothing.
There're no diamonds in there.

864
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,436
There're not?

865
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,572
Who ever told you
they were in the plaster?

866
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:21,299
That man with the false mustache
figured the same thing.

867
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:23,635
The police took them long ago, chief.

868
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,380
Hey, hold it! Stop, you morons!

869
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:32,442
To quote an old friend of mine
who's now buried,

870
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,888
'I knew too much.'

871
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,316
Seven calling Five and reporting

872
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,453
that a cherry-colored 'Moskvitch'
has been spotted

873
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:44,628
on the forest road

874
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:47,267
speeding toward
the national border.

875
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:53,771
Seven, listen to my orders!

876
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:25,429
Mama!

877
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,301
Lyolik, stop it!

878
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:32,673
Easy, Kozlodoyev, there'll be room
for all of us in the can!

879
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:28,363
NINA GREBESHKOVA

880
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:31,630
STANISLAV CHEKAN

881
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,548
VLADIMIR GULYAEV

882
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:54,557
ANDREl MIRONOV

883
01:33:56,664 --> 01:34:00,031
ANATOLY PAPANOV

884
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,926
SVETLANA SVETLICHNAYA

885
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:10,540
NONNA MORDYUKOVA

886
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:15,272
YURI NIKULIN

887
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:18,714
The End

888
01:34:19,714 --> 01:34:29,714
