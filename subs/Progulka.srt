2
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:31,222
I'm sick of your music!
Turn down the volume.

3
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:34,461
Turn it down!

4
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,176
It turned out
you are good in women.

5
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:48,210
Well, at least betterthan you are.

6
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:51,507
Women don't have will-power,
thanks God.

7
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,114
I don't have will-power?

8
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:57,954
Don't worry,
I'll put you in your place.

9
00:01:58,223 --> 00:02:01,021
I hope I'm at my place already.

10
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:02,956
You can hope.

11
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,392
- You'll get it in the neck.
- I'm kidding.

12
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:10,025
Pull over.

13
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:14,768
- I'm starting. Note the time.
- Go. I'll be watching.

14
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:18,070
- Have I ever lied to you?
- But don't turn off your phone.

15
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,542
And you don't call every minute.

16
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,041
The Stroll

17
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,462
No, you can't.

18
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,197
And why?

19
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:23,898
Because I don't give
my names to strangers.

20
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:25,134
And you are right in that.

21
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,938
Giving names to strangers
is too flippantly, it's a bad form

22
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:29,944
and I would even say
that it's vulgarity.

23
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:33,084
What beautiful eyes you have!
What's your name?

24
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,343
I'm not telling you.

25
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,646
If you want I can call you Stranger.

26
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,082
Do you know,
there is a picture with such name.

27
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:40,952
It's now being printed
in candy's wrapping.

28
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,559
Actually,
you can see it here in a museum.

29
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,329
It's not "Stranger", it's "Unknown".

30
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:49,558
And it's not here, it's in Moscow,
in Tretyakovskaya Gallery.

31
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,995
As always, everything what's good
is in Moscow. Like a tragedy.

32
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:58,040
At least I can console, that girls
in our city are more intelligent.

33
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,973
- Me?
- Yes, you.

34
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:03,309
Do you study or work?

35
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:05,541
I'm just walking.

36
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:08,209
My name is Alexey.

37
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:15,656
Do you mind having a company?
I love walking with mysterious ladies.

38
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:19,225
- Maria suits you. Maria, the name.
- Maria?

39
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:21,229
I'd call you Mary.

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,561
No my name is Olya, as simple as that.

41
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:27,065
Olga, Olga, Olga.
Something very ancient.

42
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:32,336
Some queens, Tatar incursions,
a long narrow river,

43
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:35,571
sad songs of the north people.

44
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,583
- Let's go to the north, Olga.
- To the north?

45
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,445
We'll be in fur and hide
and I'll show you a passionate dance.

46
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:45,681
Slow it down.

47
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:49,289
- You talk too much.
- Maybe.

48
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:53,554
You don't have to show off.
I'm already walking with you.

49
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,430
- Let's be informal.
- What a wonderful idea!

50
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,036
I didn't dare to ask that first.

51
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:01,172
- Where are we going to?
- Where are we going to?

52
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:05,002
Just walking.
I like just walking and looking around.

53
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:06,944
The weather is great.

54
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:09,239
I don't see anything what is
worthy of special attention.

55
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:11,713
All attention is paid to certain Olya.

56
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,677
- Do you see a man in a red T-shirt?
- Yes.

57
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:17,386
He's waving his hands.
I've been watching him for a long time.

58
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:20,457
- He is a complete idiot.
- You really think so?

59
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,217
- Wanna try?
- OK. Let's.

60
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:23,986
Excuse me.

61
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,254
- Hello.
- Hello.

62
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,455
- Would you like to go to a theatre?
- With you, babe?

63
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:31,093
- Where are you going, baby?
- Sorry, good bye.

64
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:34,400
It's really impressing.

65
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:36,598
- Are you always so good in people?
- Almost.

66
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,177
Can you say something
about this woman in the light skirt?

67
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,609
Of course.

68
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:49,383
Lazy, untidy, a mess in herflat.
She thinks about meeting her prince.

69
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:51,749
- How do you know that?
- Do you see unshaved legs?

70
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,958
That means she is lazy, untidy,
not interested in men who surround her,

71
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:58,755
varicose veins,
that means she gave a birth.

72
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:03,056
And she's wearing a white skirt, because
she wants to attract men's attention.

73
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,760
How did you know
she had scandals with her husband?

74
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:09,596
Just my imagination.
Maybe that was her reason of divorce.

75
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:11,368
She is not
an interesting subject to talk about.

76
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,340
- What did you think about me?
- About you?

77
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:19,041
You are funny, foppish,
like to be in the centre of attention.

78
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:23,176
Then, there was something else
what I thought about you.

79
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:24,652
- What was that?
- Not gonna tell you.

80
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:27,314
- Come on, tell me.
- I won't. You'd get offended.

81
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:29,687
- I won't. Please tell me.
- No.

82
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,724
You are not lucky with girls.

83
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,123
- You're right.
- You see?

84
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,131
- How did you guess?
- Somehow.

85
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:41,272
You just fall in love with wrong ones.

86
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:45,131
I have a friend, Petyunya,
he is very easy.

87
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,507
He tells me, that I sense bitches.

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,081
- Are you a bitch?
- No, I'm a very nice girl.

89
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,617
- But, of course, I have some bitching.
- I appreciate your honesty.

90
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,192
Hey, what do you think about yourself?

91
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,419
- About myself?
- Yes.

92
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,698
- I like dreaming.
- And what do you dream about?

93
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:15,601
- I pretend to be sugar.
- Swimming in a glass?

94
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:21,235
No. Like I am a brick of sugar.
Very refractory, hard.

95
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:25,782
I'm in hot tea or coffee
and I start melting.

96
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:30,747
I go to the bottom, I lie there,
merge with water, sweeten the drink.

97
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,586
And one can also break me with a spoon.
I hate when people do that.

98
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,819
When they try to break me
in the bottom of the glass.

99
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:42,088
- I hate it.
- Why do you hate that? Can you explain?

100
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:46,463
It's not me who hates it.
The sugar hates it.

101
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:50,268
- Are you serious?
- You think I'm sick?

102
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:55,277
One day, when I was taking a bath
I pretended to be Bill Clinton.

103
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:57,772
What? What were you doing?

104
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:00,243
I was divorcing Hillary
and marrying Monica.

105
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:01,407
Monica is fat.

106
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:05,546
So what? We live in London,
play saxophone, dance salsa.

107
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,284
You can't imagine how good that is!

108
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:12,385
Of course I understand, I'm old
enough, but I still can do things!

109
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:15,328
By the way, Monica presented
a bike to my birthday.

110
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,400
It's a great think.
We were riding along the city.

111
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:20,265
By the way, my hair gets grey.

112
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,440
People say, grey hair looks good to me.

113
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,837
The only thing which
worries me is my daughter, Chelsea.

114
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,610
She is a unique child.
She doesn't understand anything.

115
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,738
She is on mother's side. I tried to
talk to her, but she doesn't understand.

116
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,317
Why are you laughing?
Stop laughing.

117
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:37,717
Everybody dreams about that,
but not everybody admits that.

118
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,790
When I was a child
I wanted to be a traffic-controller.

119
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,622
- And you?
- I wanted to draw lines on roads.

120
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:45,854
Those which are at crossings.

121
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:49,860
Beautiful dream.
Beautiful. I understand you.

122
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,567
Do you dream about anything now?

123
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:54,602
I don't know. I don't think so.

124
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:57,264
But I always interview myself.

125
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:02,141
Recently I gave a press conference
about developing of Russian economics.

126
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:07,808
It was broadcasted on all TV channels
and newspapers quoted that too.

127
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:09,476
And, by the way, it was in a bath too.

128
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:12,454
You are like me.
My congratulations. You are sick too.

129
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,289
- You are an amazing girl.
- I agree.

130
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,896
Let's drink something.
Let's sit somewhere, I'll call Petya.

131
00:09:19,197 --> 00:09:21,825
I must introduce him
such a wonderful girl.

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,934
Are you talking about the one
who calls girls bitches?

133
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,602
You can introduce me to him,
but I won't go to any place.

134
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,899
Firstly, I don't drink,
secondly, I can't sit.

135
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:33,472
Do you have piles?

136
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,007
Very funny.

137
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:38,248
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
It was idiotic.

138
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,577
- Stupid and boorish.
- I'm sorry, but why can't you sit?

139
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,549
I won't tell you to spite you.

140
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,655
- Please, tell me.
- I won't.

141
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:47,314
Please.

142
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,890
I can't sit,
because I fell off a horse.

143
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:53,720
- Say what? Fell off a horse?
- I injured my spinal column.

144
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,959
Now I have to walk a lot
and I can't sit.

145
00:09:57,302 --> 00:10:00,396
- Do you work in a circus?
- You starting it again?

146
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:01,903
No, really.

147
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,801
No, I do equestrian sport.
I'm a jockey.

148
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:08,343
Ah, it's when horses dance?

149
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,913
- Yes, yes.
- Great.

150
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,011
And those who sit
on horses have crooked legs.

151
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,442
- What?
- Don't be mad.

152
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,346
Nonsense.

153
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:17,316
What's the name of the horse?

154
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:21,323
Diamond. It's a stallion.
I had Rook before him.

155
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,620
He was written off. He was old.

156
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:26,286
Is it your phone or mine?

157
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,557
I think it's mine.

158
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,595
Hello. Hi. Wait.

159
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,465
Yes.

160
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,850
Yes. As we agreed.

161
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:49,647
OK. Bye.

162
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:54,289
- May I ask you a tactless question?
- Shoot.

163
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:57,917
- Who was that?
- My coach, Vsevolod Maksimych.

164
00:10:58,096 --> 00:10:59,461
- Your coach?
- Yes.

165
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:00,962
Why were you so informal with him?

166
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:04,568
I've been known him since my childhood.
We all are informal with each other.

167
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:06,670
It's a very rude world.

168
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,534
- And you curse too?
- Sometimes.

169
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:14,940
And you thought I'm a modest girl.
I think such girls are artificial.

170
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:18,344
Like in old books when
old ladies fainted away.

171
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,747
All my life I dreamt to faint away.

172
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,481
I wish to feel dizziness
just once in my life. Never.

173
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:31,457
- I feel so bad right now. Wait.
- Olya, what's happened?

174
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,859
- I don't know what it is.
- Do you have a stomach-ache?

175
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,424
Did you buy it? Yes?

176
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:41,328
It's a way how to fool men.

177
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:46,803
You believe in everything.

178
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,437
These pigeons went crazy.

179
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:52,912
You think, that we, girls,
only wash up in a bathroom?

180
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:57,385
Actually, I don't wanna know
in details what you do there.

181
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,922
How are you gonna live with your wife?

182
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,652
Do you think
she's gonna go to neighbours?

183
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,058
You seem to be too experienced.

184
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:08,394
Are you married?

185
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,363
Oh, no. Don't wanna be married.

186
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,929
Why?

187
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:18,940
- Because I like being with myself.
- And with me?

188
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:21,339
With you?

189
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:24,138
Well, it's OK.

190
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:28,384
- So marry me then.
- What did you say?

191
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:35,449
You know what, let's do that
in... 14 minutes.

192
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:41,396
- Why in 14?
- Why not?

193
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,530
Are you kidding again
oryou are serious?

194
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:48,172
Actually, people don't say
such things to little known men.

195
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:54,411
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
- Of course not.

196
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,978
Where are you going?

197
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:02,642
Mister policeman,
do you believe in love at first sight?

198
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,378
Do you believe
in love at first sight or not?

199
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:06,454
Are you OK?

200
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:09,650
I want to know if our law machinery
believes in love at first sight.

201
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,193
- You see?
- Don't take it seriously.

202
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,123
I saw her and fell in love at once.
But she doesn't believe me.

203
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:15,956
I fell in love and forgot
about my stupid heart.

204
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:18,796
By the way, do you have a stupid heart?

205
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,200
- Don't take it seriously.
- Does he botheryou?

206
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,839
Ljust want to know if our law machinery
believes in love at first sight.

207
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,069
Do you believe in it or not.
Answer, please.

208
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,244
- Are you drunk?
- Drunk with love.

209
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:38,046
- Do you believe?
- I do, I do. Get going.

210
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:39,850
Thank you, mister policeman.

211
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,582
Thank you very much.

212
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:46,025
- Marry me.
- You are crazy.

213
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:47,721
There are so many people here.

214
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:50,561
I don't care about these people.
Just marry me.

215
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,760
- Are you crazy?
- Marry me.

216
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,599
I can't understand if you're a fool
oryou are miserable.

217
00:13:55,773 --> 00:14:02,178
I feel foryou of course,
but that's not enough for marriage.

218
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:06,548
Are you crazy? What marriage?
Maybe you agree on romance?

219
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,777
Who asks such things?

220
00:14:08,953 --> 00:14:11,547
Of course I'd like
to have a friendship with you,

221
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:14,624
but I don't believe in friendship
between a man and a woman.

222
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:18,888
And besides, you are very beautiful
and I wanna kiss you.

223
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:23,693
And I don't wanna kiss Petya,
that means this is not a friendship.

224
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:26,062
Let me kiss you.

225
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:29,597
Let me kiss you.

226
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,072
- No.
- Please.

227
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,268
I don't want that.

228
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,978
You'd better introduce me to that Petya.
You mention her every 5 minutes.

229
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:39,082
Her? Not a problem.

230
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:42,078
- I can call him right now if you want.
- OK.

231
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,756
Afriend would never leave
anotherfriend in troubles.

232
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:48,915
What? That means you are in troubles?

233
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,687
- Olya.
- Good bye then.

234
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:56,163
That was a joke, Olya.
Why are you so touchy?

235
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,236
Stop it. I hate that Petya.
I hate him.

236
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:01,505
I'm calling him, I'm calling him.

237
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:04,140
You're gonna like him.
He's a nice guy.

238
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,642
What are you gonna do
if I like him more than you expect?

239
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:09,939
- I hope it won't happen.
- But if that happens?

240
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:13,675
It won't happen, you can't like him,
because you like me.

241
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:15,945
Do you have
otherfriends besides Petya?

242
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:21,184
Friends? No. Many acquaintances,
but only one friend.

243
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,251
And what about you?

244
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,324
Rook was my friend.

245
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,291
Rook? A horse?

246
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:32,626
No, it's not a horse.
It was betterthan a man.

247
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,966
He was very attentive and loving.

248
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:40,770
He was always funny, naive.
He always protected me.

249
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:43,971
It's something, when a horse
is your best friend and not a man.

250
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:46,844
People are the real animals.

251
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:49,009
- You are so cruel.
- I'm not cruel.

252
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:51,781
How dare you to censure me?

253
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,948
If I'm cruel or not.
This is too much.

254
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:58,857
- I'm mad at you.
- I meant that you can love people too.

255
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:01,191
- Do it if you want.
- Why are you so mad?

256
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:03,926
I'm not mad any more.
Go where you were going.

257
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:07,629
- Olga, stop it, please.
- I won't stop it.

258
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,932
- I can be mad too.
- What at?

259
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:11,972
At your boorishness, for example.

260
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,373
- Boorishness?
- Yes.

261
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:25,688
Forgive me for being boorish.
I didn't mean to.

262
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,757
And you forgive me.

263
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,360
Are we OK?

264
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:35,792
- It's so hard with you as it occurred.
- Who said it was gonna be easy?

265
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:43,702
Let's try to avoid such arguments
in the future.

266
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,366
Tell me what annoys you
and I'll try not to do that.

267
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:49,271
Nothing annoys me.
Ljust don't like being judged.

268
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:54,715
If we don't fight,
how are we gonna make it up?

269
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:55,910
What do you mean?

270
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:59,648
Just as I said. The process
of making up is also a pleasant one.

271
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:03,920
Relationship
becomes tenderer and warmer.

272
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:06,096
Then let's fight again.

273
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,694
I demand a scandal!

274
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,834
- No, I can't.
- Right now!

275
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:15,029
- How can I offend you?
- You don't have to offend me.

276
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,900
I'll tell you, that you are stupid.

277
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:21,443
No. Being stupid means
to understand the world differently.

278
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,246
To be stupid is pleasant.

279
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,315
Then I'll call you a smart.

280
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:27,150
It wouldn't scare me either.

281
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:29,411
Then I'll tell you,
that we are having a fight,

282
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:32,985
that I'm upset, disconsolate, unhappy.

283
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,749
I am hurt.

284
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,723
- Start making it up.
- I won't.

285
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:39,122
- Be closerto me.
- No.

286
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:49,703
Closer and tenderer!
Otherwise I'll die.

287
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:52,142
I can die, you know?

288
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,336
I'm dying, I'm dying!

289
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,415
God, I'm dying.

290
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,117
God, Olga, I'm dying.

291
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:06,888
Olya, let me kiss you, let me kiss you.

292
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,121
This is not we were agreed to.

293
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:15,362
This is not we were agreed to.

294
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:23,769
Let me kiss you, let me kiss you.

295
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:29,040
She doesn't want to kiss,
she doesn't want to marry.

296
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,477
What a girl I found!

297
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:36,812
Leave me alone. Stop it, stop it!

298
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,115
Put me on the floor!

299
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,258
I can't be hung.

300
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:02,811
Do you want an ice-cream?

301
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:08,511
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

302
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:10,883
Guess.

303
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:13,517
Another kiss?

304
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,792
One at a time.

305
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,560
- Your lips are so soft.
- Why? They should be hard?

306
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:23,924
- Horses have the softest lips.
- You're starting it again.

307
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:25,968
I'm in love as a pelican
and she's talking about horses.

308
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:27,104
Why as a pelican?

309
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:28,465
- Why not?
- Why?

310
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,163
- Why not?
- Why?

311
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,842
As ill luck would have it,
I gotta go to Moscow today.

312
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,910
I was only once in Moscow.

313
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,140
- Maybe I shouldn't go there today?
- Why? You have to go.

314
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:40,944
- Let's go together.
- Are you crazy?

315
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:43,552
Come on, I have friends there,
it's gonna be fun.

316
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:46,118
There is a booking office overthere.
Let's go.

317
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,190
- No.
- Come on. It'd be great!

318
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,887
- It's not convenient foryou.
- Who told you that?

319
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:54,564
- Really, I can't.
- Why can't you?

320
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,298
Olya, you are the best girl
in Russian Federation.

321
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,092
I've been known you forfive minutes.

322
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,066
We'll go to a club, it's gonna be fun.

323
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,102
- It's a big challenge for me.
- Yes, it is. A very nice one.

324
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:05,936
Let's go, you won't regret! Please.

325
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,937
- I feel awkward.
- Why do you feel awkward?

326
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,407
Olya, please.

327
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,878
Let's go, Olya.
Please, say "yes".

328
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,143
Stop it. I don't like
standing in queues. Go alone.

329
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,914
- Give me your passport.
- Why?

330
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:22,091
- You don't wanna show me your age.
- I don't wanna.

331
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,521
- You don't?
- No.

332
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:25,252
Give me your passport.

333
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:26,853
You won't look at it, will you?

334
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,295
- Do you promise?
- Yes, I do.

335
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,162
Here it is.

336
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,407
Be here, wait for me.

337
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,135
I have a friend there, she'll help me.

338
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:43,974
- OK, go.
- Promise not to leave.

339
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:46,049
I promise. You have my passport.

340
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:49,317
- You sure you won't leave?
- Go.

341
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,932
Hello. Daddy, why did you call?

342
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,669
Don't do that anymore.

343
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,097
OK, as we agreed. I have one.

344
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:12,400
In a minute. I'm almost there.

345
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,587
Where've you been? Why do you call?

346
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:28,515
Catherine the First came by.

347
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,322
I'm gonna be here, Menshikov is
on the third, Elizabeth on the fourth.

348
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,623
Why me? Why should I be on the fourth?

349
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,499
No one takes pictures there.
Send herthere.

350
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:40,134
Why do you always fight?
Every day the same.

351
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:42,996
Catherine should be at the Hermitage.

352
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,602
And what about Elizabeth?

353
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:46,636
OK, let's go.

354
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:53,344
What's the difference?
People always confuse us.

355
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:54,984
I'm on the fourth.

356
00:21:57,988 --> 00:22:00,013
I don't like your attitude!

357
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:01,748
- Did you buy them?
- Sure.

358
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:04,027
Then give my passport back.

359
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:07,994
So we are going at 12
in a compartment car,

360
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:10,565
but in different compartments.
Don't be mad at me forthat.

361
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:11,997
Aren't we gonna meet Petya?

362
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:13,227
Do you want that?
I can call him if you want.

363
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:14,665
OK.

364
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:16,563
I want that very much.

365
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:22,035
It's weird. We're going to Moscow
and I don't know anything about you.

366
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:25,272
Hello. What are you doing?

367
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:28,350
- Go to Dvorcovaya Square.
- It's OK.

368
00:22:29,253 --> 00:22:31,346
Can you be there in 30 minutes?

369
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:32,784
OK. Bye.

370
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:34,751
You're gonna meet
a very beautiful girl.

371
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,959
- Stop it.
- OK. See you.

372
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:39,322
He'll come.

373
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:41,260
- Great.
- Do you need the ticket?

374
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:43,195
OK. Give it to me.

375
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:49,005
- Why?
- Give it.

376
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:53,676
Lyosha, please don't argue.

377
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:56,104
- OK?
- What's the matter?

378
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:57,644
Please, take my money forthe ticket.

379
00:22:57,848 --> 00:22:59,213
- Kidding?
- I'm not.

380
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:03,319
I can't explain the reason,
but I can't go at your expense.

381
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,387
Are you a feminist?

382
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:10,026
- Even if I were. Why?
- Olya, I earn enough.

383
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:12,754
I can afford myself
to go to Moscow.

384
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:15,327
Olya, take away the money.

385
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:18,662
No doubts that you earn enough.
I understand that.

386
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:21,634
Please. I can't explain the reason.

387
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,501
Eitheryou take the money
or I'm not going.

388
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:26,575
Are you crazy?
I told you I earn enough.

389
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:29,177
- And besides you hurt my feelings.
- I do?

390
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:30,779
Yes, you do.

391
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:32,673
I can't explain why.
Take the money, or I'm not going.

392
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,608
Olya, stop showing
your money in the street.

393
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,255
I'm not going?
That means I'm not going?

394
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:40,219
- Olya, did I invite you?
- Yes.

395
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:41,755
- You refused?
- Yes.

396
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:44,094
Bye.

397
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:52,035
I really want to go to Moscow with you.
Please understand me.

398
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,728
Take the money forthe ticket,
but in Moscow I'll be supported by you.

399
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,505
I promise.

400
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:59,108
- You promise?
- Yes, I won't open my purse.

401
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:02,175
OK. Deal.

402
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:05,804
- What meaning of this?
- There is no meaning.

403
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,280
I'll take this money
and put it in my pocket.

404
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:12,581
After we come back
I'll return it to you.

405
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:14,690
- If you don't take it...
- OK.

406
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,484
Why do you always argue with me?

407
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,185
Why do we always
sort out our relationship?

408
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:27,735
Forget it. Stop being mad.

409
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,469
I promise,
everything's gonna be perfect.

410
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:36,204
It's like we're in Paris now,
do you hearthe music?

411
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,848
- Have you been to Paris?
- No.

412
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:50,625
Don't play too loud.
I can't hear anything.

413
00:24:50,794 --> 00:24:53,285
- I'm working.
- So am I.

414
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,499
Can you shut up?
I don't hear myself.

415
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:00,466
Boor.

416
00:25:00,938 --> 00:25:03,668
Dear citizens and guests...

417
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:06,399
I'll show you
citizens and guests after all...

418
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:08,306
Continue playing, Beethoven.

419
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:12,380
- We invite you for a wonderful trip...
- How long are you gonna do that?

420
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:17,246
..by our comfortable bus.
- OK, I got it.

421
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,207
- Hello.
- Who is that?

422
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:43,175
- Who is it?
- Hi, Mom.

423
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:47,373
I remember, I'll be there soon.

424
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:49,418
Isn't that Rook?

425
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:52,184
Rook!

426
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:56,791
- My dear Rook. Hi. My dear!
- Do want to have a ride?

427
00:25:56,994 --> 00:25:58,461
Olya, where are you going?

428
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:01,496
- Did you miss me?
- Let's have a ride.

429
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:04,190
- Don't be afraid.
- Come on, let me help you.

430
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:06,732
You make money with his help?

431
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:08,838
- He is a nice guy.
- Who let you take him forthat?

432
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:12,942
- Have a ride.
- Is it good making money using him?

433
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,710
And you think
you don't need to take care of him?

434
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:18,279
- Look at his teeth.
- Don't touch him.

435
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,679
- You don't touch him!
- Leave us alone!

436
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:23,684
- Leave us!
- Are you crazy?

437
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:27,917
- I have taken care of him for 8 years.
- What are you talking about?

438
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,522
- And you're making money using him!
- Stop it, Olya!

439
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:31,992
I'll call in the club.

440
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:35,457
Calm down, maybe it's not Rook.
Maybe he looks like him.

441
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,532
I have taken care of him for 8 years.

442
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,431
Calm down, don't cry.

443
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:45,640
Don't worry, nobody's riding him.
Nobody's making money using him.

444
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,801
He's fed. He's a nice horse.
Olya, please stop crying.

445
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:50,871
- Stop it, my dear.
- I stopped.

446
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:52,709
- Stop it.
- I stopped.

447
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,675
Petya is going to show up soon
and you are crying.

448
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:59,254
- What can I do?
- Exactly, you can't do anything.

449
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,583
Calm down, my dear.

450
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,852
- What should I do to calm you down?
- Nothing.

451
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:06,029
If you want I can scream
that I love you.

452
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,456
- I love Olga Malakhova!
- Stop it!

453
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:10,600
- I love Olga Malakhova!
- Stop it!

454
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:13,259
- You are crazy!
- I love Olga Malakhova!

455
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:14,961
What are you doing?
How do you know my last name?

456
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:16,363
I saw it in your passport.

457
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:19,965
- You promised not to look.
- I saw only your last name.

458
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:22,972
Whole city knows
that you love Olga Malakhova.

459
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:26,282
- Hi.
- Hello.

460
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:33,753
What have you done to him,
so he's screaming?

461
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:36,556
I haven't done anything?

462
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:39,262
Maybe that's my fault.

463
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,364
- Whatever.
- Why are you going at her?

464
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:42,760
It was a drama here.

465
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:47,302
I don't like dramas. I prefer action.
Are we gonna stand here?

466
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:49,029
Let's go.

467
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:51,466
Let's have a drink somewhere,
orthe girl doesn't drink?

468
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:54,736
That is not the case.
She just can't sit.

469
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:57,475
She injured her spinal column.

470
00:27:57,648 --> 00:28:00,014
Congratulations.
You'll carry her in a wheelchair soon.

471
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:04,549
- She fell off a horse.
- How often does that happen to her?

472
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:06,848
What a boor!
Olga, please don't be mad at him.

473
00:28:07,024 --> 00:28:09,549
I'm not. He speaks that way
with everyone. Forget it.

474
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:12,423
- Where are we going to?
Why do you care?

475
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:15,656
Olga and I, by the way,
are going to Moscow.

476
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:20,701
We could do it without you.
Olga asked me to invite you.

477
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,702
If that so, why doesn't she speak?

478
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,602
Why don't you speak?
You can't speak either?

479
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:26,606
- No, I can't.
- Tell me something.

480
00:28:26,777 --> 00:28:28,642
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

481
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:31,041
For being silent.

482
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,878
Why are you silent?

483
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:37,418
- I'm just shy a little.
- Don't be shy.

484
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:40,056
Tell me something about yourself.
Who are you? Where are you from?

485
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,824
And why do you play games
with my simple-hearted friend Alexey?

486
00:28:42,993 --> 00:28:45,985
- I don't play games.
- Hey, leave my girlfriend alone.

487
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:50,600
- Are you his girlfriend?
- I don't know.

488
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,531
- No, tell me.
- I don't know, I met him not long ago.

489
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:55,729
You see?
And you said it's your girlfriend.

490
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:58,397
They are all the same.

491
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:00,475
- You didn't understand me.
- You got it?

492
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:05,740
I'm not used to answer such questions,
but why do you disconcert me?

493
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,678
Disconcert? What a word.

494
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:09,910
Petya, stop showing off. Stop it!

495
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:12,021
You know what I'm thinking about?

496
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:13,884
We can drink
while we walk, don't you think?

497
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:15,786
- What would your mother buy?
- Pepsi.

498
00:29:15,926 --> 00:29:19,589
- Maybe we should buy Chupa-Chups.
- Hey, stop that immediately!

499
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,459
OK, I'm kidding.

500
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:23,758
The same foryou?

501
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:27,698
Olya, don't be mad at him.
Actually, he is the kindest man.

502
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,169
I can see that. I'm not mad at all.

503
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:34,171
- Olya, he is good. Really.
- No doubt.

504
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:37,879
So why are you so shy then?
You don't say a word. Why?

505
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:43,076
- I need to get used to him.
- Get used faster or I'll send him home.

506
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,911
I don't want you to quarrel
with yourfriend because of me.

507
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:49,650
Me and Petya?
We are friends from the second form.

508
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:52,954
There is no such woman
because of who we could quarrel.

509
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:54,757
Maybe there is.

510
00:29:54,865 --> 00:30:00,030
Just imagine she is somewhere,
in a toilet, picking her nose.

511
00:30:00,204 --> 00:30:04,732
She is fat and ugly, stuttering.

512
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:07,473
How lovely!

513
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:09,544
Olga, do you love me? Just a bit.

514
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:11,647
- A bit?
- Yes.

515
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,079
Like this.

516
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,878
- Are we going to Moscow?
- Too much time before it happens.

517
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:19,887
- Come on, let's go.
- Petya is coming. Let's wait for him.

518
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:37,797
- Alive?
- Alive.

519
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:40,102
Where is my beer. Give me a spanner.

520
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:42,211
A spanner?

521
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:52,186
They've built the city on the swamp. Now
they wonder why there's so much water.

522
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:55,491
Next time let him go down there.

523
00:30:57,494 --> 00:31:04,058
- Who, Pyotrthe First?
- What Pyotr? Philimonov.

524
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:12,004
Sorry.

525
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:48,934
- How old are you?
- 22.

526
00:32:49,072 --> 00:32:52,064
- Why did you tell him and didn't tell me?
- You saw my passport.

527
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:54,267
I promised not to look at it.

528
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,043
And I didn't look.

529
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:59,079
This is the right approach.
Any woman would tell me anything.

530
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:02,115
They are afraid of me.
They feel that I see through them.

531
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:04,082
- Am I right?
- I think so.

532
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:06,381
And as foryou, Lyosha,
girls think you are dummy.

533
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:08,782
I don't care.
Olya, consider me as a dummy.

534
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:09,857
OK.

535
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,322
- Just like that.
- All right.

536
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:13,925
And you, Petya, will always be alone.
You'd be so old when you come to us.

537
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:18,124
Very ugly,
with hair out of your nose, ears.

538
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:23,136
With ugly glasses. One shoe would be
yellow, the other one - brown.

539
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:27,709
You'd always complain about your life,
grumble, eat a whole pot with soup,

540
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:29,311
which Olya cooked.

541
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,876
- She'd knit you a scarf.
- I can't knit.

542
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:36,177
You'll learn how to. And you'd try
to hang yourself with it and fail it.

543
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:40,346
The lamp would be broken
and yourfemoral neck too.

544
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,317
And we'd come
to visit you in the hospital,

545
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,651
so cheerful and healthy.
And we'd bring oranges and milk.

546
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:48,889
You'll be the first
who comes to me to watch football.

547
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:50,965
Am I right, Malakhova?

548
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:55,070
No. I think all your life
you'll be single, Petya.

549
00:33:55,272 --> 00:34:00,005
And then you'll marry some bitch,
who will seize the flat, the car

550
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:01,769
and the country house.

551
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:04,412
And you'll cook pelmeni foryourself
while she is in a beauty parlour.

552
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:06,773
Do I look like an idiot?

553
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:10,876
Not at all. Ljust think that women
are much slyerthan you think.

554
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,385
I don't know why you
considerthem as stupid people.

555
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:14,189
I don't think so.
I think men are cleverer.

556
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:17,383
I agree.
Men are cleverer, wiser and slyer.

557
00:34:18,328 --> 00:34:20,421
Look, maybe something will come of her.

558
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:22,129
- I told you that.
- What did you tell?

559
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:24,995
I'll examine her,
maybe I will even marry her.

560
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:26,328
I don't wanna be married.

561
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,903
- You don't?
- I don't.

562
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:29,197
And she doesn't want to marry.

563
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:35,143
You idiot! Are you crazy?

564
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:38,371
- Come on, let's run.
- Maybe he's yourfriend?

565
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,680
Let's go.

566
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:42,475
Who can do it faster?

567
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,286
Petya, are you with us?

568
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:50,221
I would never let a woman to outrun me.

569
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:52,887
Excuse me.

570
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:56,388
Come on, guys!

571
00:34:57,133 --> 00:35:01,069
Olya, you are so crazy!

572
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:04,440
We'll leave you in the dust!

573
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:07,402
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Come on, come on.

574
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:09,438
Excuse me.

575
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,289
Hello!

576
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,154
Daddy, you are a scum!

577
00:35:25,328 --> 00:35:27,125
Why did you do that?
I'm gonna kill you.

578
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:29,788
You were about to ruin my story!

579
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,865
OK. I'm going.

580
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,798
All right. Agreed. Bye.

581
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:50,046
- So?
- What?

582
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:53,820
How do you find her?

583
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:57,816
I don't know.
She's got a very sly face.

584
00:35:57,994 --> 00:36:00,428
Come on! Herface is so childish.

585
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:04,426
That's what I don't like.
Ulyana is enough foryou.

586
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:07,002
You see a bitch in every woman.

587
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:11,936
Once in a blue moon I met a normal
girl and you suspect her in everything.

588
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:14,269
I don't believe clever girls.

589
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:16,969
Women don't have much brains,
but they have much wisdom.

590
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm trying foryou.

591
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:21,883
Because when you see someone
on the other side of the street

592
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:24,282
you start thinking
how you're gonna name the third child.

593
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:27,049
Olya, what took you so long?

594
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:31,250
I think that was a bad idea
with this climbing.

595
00:36:31,962 --> 00:36:35,125
- I could've broken my leg.
- Look how beautiful it is.

596
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:37,823
That is where Petya lives.

597
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:39,262
And there we were walking.

598
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:42,337
- Excuse me.
- Be careful.

599
00:36:43,974 --> 00:36:45,601
Are you all right, Olya?

600
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,569
Look, it's so great!

601
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:52,014
Olya, what's happened?

602
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,545
I'll hold you, you hit her cheeks.

603
00:36:56,553 --> 00:36:58,885
- Hit harder!
- I can't!

604
00:36:59,055 --> 00:37:01,046
- Can we help you?
- No, we're fine.

605
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,919
- Olya, are you OK?
- Don't hit too hard.

606
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:07,619
That's fine. My mother
has the same disease. That's fine.

607
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,488
Olya, are you OK?

608
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,861
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

609
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:13,400
Don't hit her.

610
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,037
Let's go then.

611
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,898
I'm... just...

612
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,270
- Let me hold her.
- What's happened, Olya?

613
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:21,410
I saw down, my head began to swim.

614
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,841
- That can happen with anyone.
- It's the first time with me.

615
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:27,141
- You hinder me. Go straight on.
- Let me hold her.

616
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:30,616
- How did you manage to faint away?
- I feel so awkward.

617
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:33,252
Maybe I should hold you?

618
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:36,620
I'm not sick, I'm not a disabled.
I am all fine.

619
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:40,121
- Lyosha, go ahead.
- Yes, Lyosha, go ahead.

620
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:41,854
Excuse me, do you have some water?

621
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:44,557
- Maybe you need my help?
- No, we're fine.

622
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:47,326
She is the seventh today.

623
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:48,994
She looks so big.

624
00:37:49,172 --> 00:37:52,039
Why do they climb
if they can't stand heights?

625
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,301
Thanks God, she has someone to go with.

626
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:56,877
Thanks God, thanks God.
I don't believe in your God!

627
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:58,105
And I never believed!

628
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:00,442
- It's very fashionable...
- Could you tell me where is the exit?

629
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:02,346
- There.
- This way.

630
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:04,419
- There? Yes?
- Yes, on the left.

631
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:08,557
- I wouldn't say so, Galina.
- Do I have to go right or left?

632
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:11,126
- It depends on where you are going.
- That way, go that way.

633
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:12,954
But it's betterto turn left.

634
00:38:13,129 --> 00:38:16,257
He makes the sixth round and
hasn't figured out what way to go yet.

635
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:19,994
OK. Let's continue.
Sauce for hot dogs.

636
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,899
Ketchup.

637
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:24,163
Correct.

638
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:26,342
Starts with "K".

639
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,710
- A grunting animal?
- A pig.

640
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,607
Correct. Pig.

641
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:34,210
- Are you OK?
- I think yes.

642
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:38,120
I have to start your re-education.

643
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:41,382
You will swarm up a rope,
do jogging every morning

644
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:43,651
and afterthat I'm gonna whip you
to keep you in a good shape.

645
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:44,721
- To whip?
- Yes.

646
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,154
You are not the first
who tells me that.

647
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,025
Many people like this idea.

648
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,632
- Because you look like...
- An unwhipped.

649
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,926
Yes, you're right.

650
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:53,194
Don't worry,
I'll work on you.

651
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,734
And afterthat I'll marry you.

652
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:58,472
I like you without re-educating.
Particularly without Petya's.

653
00:38:58,608 --> 00:39:02,100
Maybe Petya's wife would
swarm up a rope and jog.

654
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:05,406
- I don't think my wife would need that.
- No, I can't swarm up.

655
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:07,516
- What?
- I can't swarm up a rope.

656
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,140
- Why?
- Wasn't taught in school?

657
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,253
No, I was always free
from physics training.

658
00:39:11,421 --> 00:39:14,015
I was always sick
and I don't like sport in general.

659
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,351
And what about horses?

660
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,754
It's different.

661
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,653
Let's don't talk about horses.

662
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,491
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:26,161
Let's go to the embankment.
I love walking there.

664
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:28,031
Do you mind, Petya?

665
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:32,163
Stop being so formal. I hit your
cheeks, but you're still formal.

666
00:39:32,308 --> 00:39:33,240
Alright.

667
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:35,104
By the way, I guess I should
challenge you to a duel

668
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:36,575
for hurting the lady.

669
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:39,715
What are you talking about? I came
to her senses and you challenge me?

670
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,313
- I can shoot in the air.
- You mean fart?

671
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:44,544
Petya, you are a boor.
What are you laughing at?

672
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:48,282
Why are you laughing?
Do you like soldier's humour?

673
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:51,689
Olga, I thought you are a decent girl.

674
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:54,189
- It was really funny.
- Maybe I disturb you?

675
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,422
Maybe I should go home?

676
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:57,463
I don't know why
Alexey is pitching into me.

677
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,593
I am pitching into you?
This is me who disturbs you?

678
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:04,239
- Alexey, stop it.
- OK, I'm leaving. I'm sorry.

679
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:06,136
- Please, Lyosha.
- Why are you so angry?

680
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,709
- Go to hell!
- Look! Awedding.

681
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:11,605
I don't get it. Why all women
like watching weddings so much?

682
00:40:11,781 --> 00:40:14,079
It's great. Look at her veil.

683
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:19,085
All men are waiting till they
finish walking and start drinking.

684
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:29,321
When I will be marrying I will leave
the city afterthe registry office.

685
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:32,161
You said
you didn't want to get married.

686
00:40:33,236 --> 00:40:34,828
I'll have to.

687
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,798
I'll have to, won't I?

688
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:39,072
I don't know.

689
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:41,800
You don't know?
Why are you still angry?

690
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:46,480
Am I indecent if I understand
soldier's humour?

691
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:50,141
I love many things.
I love theatre, stars,

692
00:40:50,353 --> 00:40:53,151
films, music, flowers.

693
00:40:53,323 --> 00:40:55,120
- Which?
- Which flowers?

694
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,851
I love daisies.

695
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,493
I don't like roses,
but I do like daisies.

696
00:41:01,564 --> 00:41:04,294
Hold it.
Don't go, I'll be right back.

697
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:06,128
Where are you going to?

698
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:07,735
Petya,
if something happens I'll kill you.

699
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:17,636
Where do you think he went?

700
00:41:17,814 --> 00:41:19,805
- To get flowers.
- Right.

701
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:24,176
- Real romantic.
- He is too cute.

702
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:26,582
Are you going to Moscow with him?

703
00:41:26,756 --> 00:41:28,656
I don't think we're going.

704
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:30,588
You're not sure you're going?

705
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,127
If you are interested,
I gave him money forthe ticket.

706
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:36,394
Maybe I will go.

707
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:40,400
- You're playing games with him?
- No. Ljust haven't decided it yet.

708
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:44,198
That means playing games.
The usual women's thing.

709
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:47,501
Why does he need
to know about my doubts?

710
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,804
He might be offended.
He'll be offended by other people.

711
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:53,444
Why do you think so?

712
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:59,551
I can see that. Because such people
like he are not too lucky in life.

713
00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:01,952
If they succeed in something
they blossom,

714
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:05,853
but if they fail in something
they fade away.

715
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:08,561
- Why do you think he's yourfriend?
- Why?

716
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:12,360
Because you are strong, free.

717
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:15,527
You are your own master.

718
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,435
When did you manage to study me?

719
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:24,671
You even talk rudely,
so people wouldn't talk to you.

720
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:29,314
Actually you are not quite right.
I neverthought about it.

721
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:31,385
You made it up.

722
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:33,586
Maybe.

723
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:39,160
Do you think this makes you different
that you don't think who you are?

724
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:45,933
Do you fearfor him?

725
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:49,499
I don't fear, but I feel uneasy.

726
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:52,266
That's right. So do I.

727
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,241
Do you like him?

728
00:42:57,547 --> 00:42:59,276
A lot.

729
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:05,412
Ljust have a feeling,
that I'm 10 years olderthan him.

730
00:43:05,688 --> 00:43:07,781
- I don't lie. I wait.
- What for?

731
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:12,827
That it will pass one day.
He is a child. He is weak.

732
00:43:19,268 --> 00:43:21,759
- A child.
- He's weak.

733
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:23,905
And are you strong?

734
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:28,607
No. Strong women is a pathology.

735
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,647
You are not stupid
that you seems you are.

736
00:43:31,814 --> 00:43:35,545
- I'm sorry for being strict.
- That's okay.

737
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:37,516
I hope you won't tell him
about our conversation.

738
00:43:37,653 --> 00:43:38,551
Why should I?

739
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:42,248
I don't believe in your wit,
but I believe in your intuition.

740
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:45,417
- Enter into an alliance with him?
- An alliance?

741
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:46,926
Yes.

742
00:43:47,764 --> 00:43:49,732
Here's your Romeo.

743
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:51,298
And yours too.

744
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:52,695
Daisies don't grow.

745
00:44:00,443 --> 00:44:03,037
Why didn't you take your girl?
Why did you take one from Moscow?

746
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,745
Why do you care?

747
00:44:05,948 --> 00:44:08,348
You care about everything.

748
00:44:09,685 --> 00:44:11,414
Everybody goes to Moscow.

749
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:13,885
Why do you talk about Moscow so much?

750
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:16,890
You'd better get married by yourself.

751
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:51,678
Maybe we'd better get a car.
Aren't you tired of walking?

752
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:54,789
I hate cars.

753
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:57,950
- Run!
- Olya!

754
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:00,962
Wait!

755
00:46:16,879 --> 00:46:19,177
- Where are we going to?
- Does that matter?

756
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:23,878
- Go and buy tickets.
- Why me? You pay.

757
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:25,611
- Why me?
- Go, go.

758
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:27,016
I can pay.

759
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:33,587
Just a minute, we'll pay.

760
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,461
500 roubles.

761
00:46:41,871 --> 00:46:44,533
- Counterfeit?
- Sure.

762
00:46:46,008 --> 00:46:47,737
Do you have a smaller note?

763
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:54,577
I often have a dream that
if you jump properly, you could fly.

764
00:46:55,151 --> 00:46:57,483
I fly every night.

765
00:46:57,653 --> 00:46:59,120
That means you're growing.

766
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:01,012
No, it doesn't.

767
00:47:01,724 --> 00:47:05,091
Many people have such dreams
till they get old, but they don't grow.

768
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:08,424
Actually, when you grow
you have a dream that you fall.

769
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,793
Do you know,
there are such bumps on the road,

770
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,837
when you jump on the car
it takes your breath away.

771
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:20,032
Guys, stop whispering.
Here are yourtickets.

772
00:47:20,209 --> 00:47:24,441
- Nowadays we don't have such bumps.
- They patched them.

773
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:25,807
What's yourticket?

774
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,745
Excuse me.

775
00:47:33,923 --> 00:47:35,288
I have a lucky one.

776
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,183
- You have?
- Yes, I do.

777
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,619
You gotta eat it! Come on!

778
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:41,791
I need to make a wish first.

779
00:47:52,108 --> 00:47:54,008
Be careful.

780
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:58,112
Leave it!

781
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:03,881
Who is yours?

782
00:48:06,055 --> 00:48:08,751
Let me tell you a fortune.

783
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:11,727
I can tell you
lots of things about you.

784
00:48:23,906 --> 00:48:25,999
Ljust don't have anything.

785
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:28,902
Are you sure I'll have a rich husband?

786
00:48:29,178 --> 00:48:31,612
We are in a hurry we can't stay.

787
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:33,544
What did they tell you?

788
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:35,240
- They told me that I...
- Let's go.

789
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:36,915
Where are you going to?

790
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,212
Open the doors please!

791
00:48:39,622 --> 00:48:41,021
What's going on, Olga?

792
00:48:47,563 --> 00:48:49,087
Stop!

793
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:01,276
Come on!

794
00:49:09,218 --> 00:49:11,311
Damn it!

795
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:15,153
Let's see what we have left.
The phone is here.

796
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,656
All wallets are here.

797
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:19,886
Check if you have everything.

798
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:26,558
I don't have a wallet. They took it
from the pocket and I didn't feel that.

799
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:29,228
Olya, what's happened?

800
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:32,374
- Guys, it's just great!
- Why do they need my pass?

801
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:35,802
- Olya, what's up?
- Olya, what has happened?

802
00:49:39,081 --> 00:49:40,571
I can't stand it.

803
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:42,011
Get up.

804
00:49:42,184 --> 00:49:44,914
What idiots you are! Just great!

805
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:47,282
What is great?

806
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:49,215
It's just great, guys!

807
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:51,916
They swindled us.
We were like three idiots.

808
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:53,857
So what are you happy about?
We don't have money.

809
00:49:53,996 --> 00:49:55,896
Blockheads! Real blockheads!

810
00:49:56,065 --> 00:49:57,293
We lost our money!

811
00:49:57,666 --> 00:50:00,863
They are actors, real actors.

812
00:50:01,036 --> 00:50:05,063
You amaze me.
Another woman would sob now.

813
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:08,870
- Why?
- Because we have been robbed.

814
00:50:09,044 --> 00:50:12,172
I can pay you money
to see such performance again.

815
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:14,908
It's great, isn't it?

816
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:17,211
- Olya, I don't have any money.
- So what?

817
00:50:17,386 --> 00:50:19,946
Petya you have to work today.
I'll go to grab some beer.

818
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:21,987
Money is not a problem, guys!

819
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,687
- Buy me a bottle too.
- And one for me.

820
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:29,160
- You don't drink.
- I do. Yes, I do.

821
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:30,855
- You don't drink.
- Want a beer?

822
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:33,399
After such adventure I want to drink.
Petya, tell him that I'm an adult.

823
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:36,398
- Olya, are you sure?
- This is my treat.

824
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:38,967
- Which do you want?
- I don't care.

825
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:41,143
- Which?
- I don't care.

826
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:46,641
Malakhova, good girl.
I'm gonna drink foryou.

827
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:54,220
Olga, you surprised me. Be careful.

828
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:07,463
- Do you still love me?
- I hate you.

829
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,165
- No, seriously.
- I am serious.

830
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:17,205
- You like Petya, don't you?
- He's nice.

831
00:51:17,379 --> 00:51:19,347
And what about me?

832
00:51:19,715 --> 00:51:21,342
So are you.

833
00:51:23,018 --> 00:51:25,145
Maybe we should leave this place?

834
00:51:25,321 --> 00:51:27,312
- Let's get out.
- He'll get mad.

835
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:29,287
He'll understand.

836
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:33,053
- I can't do that.
- Okay, I'm kidding.

837
00:51:33,762 --> 00:51:36,788
It seems to me,
that you speak only to him.

838
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:40,100
- Are you jealous?
- Even if I am.

839
00:51:40,336 --> 00:51:42,201
Are you serious?

840
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:45,101
I was trying to be his friend
only to make you feel better.

841
00:51:45,307 --> 00:51:47,275
- For me?
- Yes.

842
00:51:47,476 --> 00:51:49,774
- Really?
- Honestly.

843
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:51,412
Excuse me.

844
00:51:54,149 --> 00:51:56,014
Hello.

845
00:51:56,218 --> 00:51:58,311
Yes. Just a minute.

846
00:52:02,224 --> 00:52:03,953
Drink this foamy beer.

847
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:06,927
- Is this one for me?
- No, for Olya.

848
00:52:07,096 --> 00:52:09,087
You can drink, I don't care.

849
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:11,095
Who does keep calling you?

850
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,497
Different people.
Now a friend called me.

851
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,463
Why didn't you ask herto join us?

852
00:52:17,072 --> 00:52:20,303
She's got flu. She is in bed.
That's why she called.

853
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:22,136
It's so boring to stay at home.

854
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:23,902
- Give me the beer.
- Take it.

855
00:52:24,113 --> 00:52:26,343
Let's go somewhere to sit.
It's too dirty here.

856
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:28,506
You can't sit, Olya.

857
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:29,943
I forgot.

858
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,019
- Let's go.
- Where?

859
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:36,317
Let's go to Tuchkov,
to pass all streets quicker.

860
00:52:37,226 --> 00:52:39,820
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't like it here.

861
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:41,496
My darling, you're not right.

862
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:43,957
Look at this magnificent cathedral.

863
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,565
Yeah, you're right.

864
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:48,961
Anyway, I don't like it here.
Some pipes are everywhere.

865
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:53,532
There are so many pipes here.
Everything honks here.

866
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:56,170
Especially in spring.
I can always hear it.

867
00:52:56,345 --> 00:52:58,108
By the way, can you whistle?

868
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,180
- What do you mean?
- Using two fingers.

869
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:02,509
I can.
I can show you.

870
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:07,217
Did you see that?

871
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,081
I have learned
fortwo months to do that.

872
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:11,556
All my flat was in salvia.

873
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:15,489
- And why did you do that?
- For no reason.

874
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:18,197
Once I imagined that I left my home.

875
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:23,829
I have lived
in lofts for several months.

876
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,438
So it's a horrible story.

877
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:27,508
And I got in touch with some gang.

878
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:30,311
A leader of that gang became my lover.

879
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:34,210
He was so ugly. He drank.
I can't understand how I lived with him.

880
00:53:34,383 --> 00:53:35,577
But that's not important.

881
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:37,886
We robbed in a company.
And I supposed to be as an alarm signal.

882
00:53:38,053 --> 00:53:41,113
And since such people
should know how to whistle

883
00:53:41,256 --> 00:53:43,190
I learned how to do that.

884
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,259
Wait, I don't understand.
Are you serious? Did that happen?

885
00:53:45,427 --> 00:53:46,894
No, I made it up.

886
00:53:47,096 --> 00:53:50,896
She told me that she was Bill Clinton,
when she was taking a bath.

887
00:53:51,066 --> 00:53:52,533
It's something special.

888
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:54,893
What should I do
if I like fantasizing?

889
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:57,572
I know what you should do.
You should be a writer.

890
00:53:57,906 --> 00:54:00,534
You can write detective stories.
I would believe.

891
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:04,004
- You can make lots of money with that.
- I have already thought about it,

892
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:07,339
but I'm not interested,
because I have enough money.

893
00:54:07,516 --> 00:54:09,381
Oh, a rich fianc? E?

894
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:12,154
Not a rich, but not a poor either.

895
00:54:12,154 --> 00:54:14,247
I inherited a lot from my grandfather.

896
00:54:14,423 --> 00:54:16,015
Actually I haven't got it yet,
but soon I will.

897
00:54:16,191 --> 00:54:17,658
- Who was your grandfather?
- A sculptor.

898
00:54:17,993 --> 00:54:19,654
He was making
Lenin's all overthe world.

899
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:21,019
Great.

900
00:54:21,196 --> 00:54:25,326
Yeah, he argued with my mother
when she got married to her student.

901
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,867
He was from Mozambique. He was black.

902
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,163
Ever since
my grandfather couldn't forgive her.

903
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:32,603
And he didn't talk till he passed away.

904
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:37,139
She got divorced already,
got married my father.

905
00:54:40,716 --> 00:54:46,177
And he inherited everything to me:
The country house, the flat, the car.

906
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:51,526
I need to wait for a half a year,
so I could sell the flat.

907
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:54,025
Wait, Olya, why do you have to sell it?

908
00:54:54,229 --> 00:54:55,958
We'll live there together.

909
00:54:56,165 --> 00:54:58,565
We can start even tomorrow.

910
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:02,329
Well done. She's got a portion.
What have you got?

911
00:55:02,504 --> 00:55:05,473
I can buy a car.

912
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:07,370
Something like this?

913
00:55:07,576 --> 00:55:09,544
Good car.

914
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:11,110
No, I don't think so.

915
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,577
Why?

916
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:16,177
What don't you like?

917
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:19,752
Because this inheritance
is a very complex story.

918
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,118
I've made this story up 2 minutes ago.

919
00:55:24,293 --> 00:55:25,988
She made it up.

920
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:28,152
You started dreaming
when she made it up.

921
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,025
I've furnished
the flat in my head already.

922
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,190
Malakhova, you're genius. Cheers.

923
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:35,063
- To Malakhova.
- Olya, hold on.

924
00:55:35,237 --> 00:55:37,398
Are you gonna lie to me
and I'm gonna believe it?

925
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,734
I don't lie, I fantasize.
I told you that.

926
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:42,373
- I am a honest girl.
- You are unique, Malakhova.

927
00:55:42,444 --> 00:55:44,969
If you marry him,
let me be your lover.

928
00:55:45,147 --> 00:55:46,739
- You?
- Yes, you'll tell me stories.

929
00:55:47,082 --> 00:55:49,983
It's very interesting.
What are you talking about?

930
00:55:50,552 --> 00:55:53,612
You'll get divorced anyway, my children.
I'll be here, not too far.

931
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:56,519
- Why are we gonna get divorced?
- First you should get married.

932
00:55:56,658 --> 00:55:58,387
Petya, I don't like your jokes.

933
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,427
Malakhova, he is a very hard person.

934
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,757
He's a romantic, besides that
he's a nervous romantic.

935
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:07,193
- Sometimes it happens to him.
- Are you serious?

936
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:09,496
- Me is totally different.
- Because you are a dull.

937
00:56:10,606 --> 00:56:14,235
Thank you, my friend.
Actually I agree with you.

938
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:15,705
I'm a dull a little.

939
00:56:16,044 --> 00:56:17,568
Is he really a dull?
I didn't notice that.

940
00:56:17,746 --> 00:56:19,338
I thought he was quite clever.

941
00:56:19,515 --> 00:56:23,110
I think intelligence
would ruin my world view.

942
00:56:23,285 --> 00:56:25,651
- Look at Alexey.
- I'm looking at him.

943
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:28,619
As my grandmother would say:
"Nice head, but belongs to a fool".

944
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:31,624
Olya, do you believe him?
Look at him. This is a boor.

945
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:33,661
A man with a very difficult nature.

946
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:36,423
Mind you, my dear,
someone else is a boor now.

947
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:38,759
Stop it, guys, stop it!

948
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:42,195
Tell me I'm a cat or a lamb?

949
00:56:42,404 --> 00:56:45,703
- Do I look like a cat?
- Or a goat?

950
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:48,475
I don't think so.

951
00:56:48,644 --> 00:56:51,545
Too pity.
I hoped on your intuition.

952
00:56:51,713 --> 00:56:55,205
You know, sometimes
I feel like a poor cat.

953
00:56:55,384 --> 00:56:57,511
- I know.
- People don't notice that.

954
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:00,244
Excuse me, Pyotr,
can I talk to you for a second?

955
00:57:00,422 --> 00:57:03,482
- Only 3 minutes.
- Where are you going to, guys?

956
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:05,159
Olya, just for a few minutes.

957
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:08,353
- Are you going to fight?
- We'll be back soon.

958
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,165
- Petya, what's going on?
- Everything's obvious.

959
00:57:13,502 --> 00:57:17,666
What is obvious?
Are you taking my girl away?

960
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,068
You're absolutely right.

961
00:57:22,277 --> 00:57:25,212
- You are so calm.
- Why should I be not?

962
00:57:29,885 --> 00:57:31,716
Petya, are you insane?

963
00:57:31,887 --> 00:57:33,616
Lyosha, what do you want from me?

964
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:38,055
- I want you to leave immediately.
- I won't.

965
00:57:41,163 --> 00:57:44,189
You know, I used to call you a friend.

966
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:47,267
Yes, I still am.
I'm your best friend, you are mine.

967
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:49,427
Then how can you behave like that?

968
00:57:49,605 --> 00:57:51,539
I behave as I always did.

969
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,208
No. I think it's mean.

970
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:56,776
What do you want from me?
You want to sort out our relationship?

971
00:57:56,912 --> 00:57:58,539
I don't like such things.

972
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:01,341
There is a girl.
We both like her. That's great.

973
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,711
- What do we have to sort out?
- OK.

974
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:08,755
We won't sort it out.
Just wanna know what you think about it.

975
00:58:08,924 --> 00:58:10,357
If that's honestly enough or not.

976
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:18,295
I meet a girl, start walking with her,
I kiss her and you appears all in white.

977
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,637
You take my girl away
and tell me you are my best friend.

978
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:25,636
Tell me seriously, why...

979
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:28,308
Seriously? Want to know seriously?

980
00:58:28,477 --> 00:58:30,604
She's not just my girlfriend.
It's not that ljust like her.

981
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:33,542
She's not just my woman.
She's made especially for me.

982
00:58:33,715 --> 00:58:38,618
You need another one, stupid. You need
a calm one, who'd only listen to you.

983
00:58:38,787 --> 00:58:40,652
And youngerthan you are.

984
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:43,620
She's not foryou,
not foryourtemper.

985
00:58:43,825 --> 00:58:46,157
- That means she's foryou?
- Yes.

986
00:58:46,728 --> 00:58:48,696
I understand that. She understands that.

987
00:58:48,864 --> 00:58:52,231
And what's the most important,
do you understand that?

988
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:54,801
If you weren't my friend
I would've taken her away.

989
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,801
And I would've sent you home.

990
00:58:56,972 --> 00:59:01,204
But since you are my best friend
I'm honest with you. Leave herto me.

991
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:04,912
You'll have time to play with someone.
You'll fall in love.

992
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:08,216
And don't smile. I know you enough.

993
00:59:08,784 --> 00:59:11,378
Thank you, Petya.
I got it, you care about me.

994
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:13,680
A profound bow foryou.

995
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:19,659
But let me figure out by myself
whom I need and whom I don't.

996
00:59:19,828 --> 00:59:22,922
- You got it?
- I did. I really did.

997
00:59:23,265 --> 00:59:27,326
You are not an obstacle for me.
And I am not foryou.

998
00:59:27,502 --> 00:59:30,164
Let her decide that.
Everything's clear.

999
00:59:30,772 --> 00:59:33,366
- Pyotr.
- Let's go.

1000
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:35,271
I'm not going with you.

1001
00:59:35,444 --> 00:59:37,241
- You will.
- I won't.

1002
00:59:37,446 --> 00:59:38,970
Come on, it's not polite
to keep a girl waiting.

1003
00:59:39,948 --> 00:59:41,438
Son of a bitch.

1004
00:59:42,918 --> 00:59:45,182
Why are you alone, beauty?

1005
00:59:45,354 --> 00:59:46,844
- Are you sad?
- No.

1006
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:51,781
- I was letting my oldest dream come true.
- Which one?

1007
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,258
I threw a bottle
into the water and it's floating now.

1008
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:56,192
Olya, answer me please who...?

1009
00:59:56,365 --> 00:59:58,458
Guys, what's going on
on the other side of the river?

1010
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:00,532
Why there are so many people there?

1011
01:00:00,702 --> 01:00:02,670
Zenit is playing today.

1012
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:06,934
Zenit? Then maybe we shouldn't go there.
We may be beaten.

1013
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:09,903
- Let's change the bridge.
- Nobody will beat us. I promise.

1014
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,742
What time is it?

1015
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:15,576
5 minutes to 4.
Do you hurry somewhere?

1016
01:00:15,717 --> 01:00:18,550
No. What time do we have a train at?

1017
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,245
- We won't be late, will we?
- Are you going?

1018
01:00:21,423 --> 01:00:24,859
I didn't reject such journey.

1019
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:26,892
Are you sure we won't be beaten?

1020
01:00:27,062 --> 01:00:29,553
Actually, Petya is right.
Sometimes they hit each other.

1021
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:31,460
But they don't touch strangers.

1022
01:00:31,633 --> 01:00:33,294
- Have you ever visited football?
- Of course, not.

1023
01:00:33,468 --> 01:00:34,867
We definitely must go there.

1024
01:00:35,037 --> 01:00:38,268
Don't worry, ourfans are peaceful.
Spartak is nothing in comparison to ours.

1025
01:00:39,408 --> 01:00:41,933
- What did you want to ask?
- No, nothing.

1026
01:00:42,277 --> 01:00:43,710
Are you sure?

1027
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:45,903
Do you want me to guess
what you wanted to ask?

1028
01:00:46,081 --> 01:00:47,673
I'll whisper it to you
and you tell me if I'm right.

1029
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:51,352
Actually, more than 2 words
one say aloud.

1030
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:55,421
I'll tell you something too.
Go and don't listen.

1031
01:01:04,366 --> 01:01:06,732
Anyway, it's a little bit scary.

1032
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:08,733
Don't worry,
do you see how many police officers?

1033
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:12,305
If you were a football fan
I would never let you go alone.

1034
01:01:12,474 --> 01:01:14,840
- I would visit all places with you.
- Am I a kid?

1035
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:16,500
Yes, you're a kid.

1036
01:01:16,678 --> 01:01:19,044
What if you are arrested or beaten?
I'd worry.

1037
01:01:19,381 --> 01:01:20,905
If you're with me I'd defend you.

1038
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:22,516
Hey, you treat me like a mother.

1039
01:01:22,684 --> 01:01:24,777
- I treat you like a father.
- I'm not talking to you.

1040
01:01:24,986 --> 01:01:26,715
OK, guys. Good bye.

1041
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,358
I told you everything,
why are you showing off?

1042
01:01:31,526 --> 01:01:32,720
And you don't be a child either.

1043
01:01:32,894 --> 01:01:34,885
I'm not. Ljust want...

1044
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:39,026
- OK, Petya, I'm sorry.
- Wait a second.

1045
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:41,562
You don't have to defend me.

1046
01:01:41,837 --> 01:01:44,829
That would be so great
if you, Lyosha, were in trouble

1047
01:01:46,575 --> 01:01:48,702
and I'd save you.

1048
01:01:50,112 --> 01:01:56,517
No, it's much better if you are
paralysed and I'd take care of you.

1049
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:59,585
I would feed you, would...

1050
01:01:59,788 --> 01:02:01,517
No, no, wait.

1051
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:04,750
I'd wash you,
I'd read newspapers to you.

1052
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,622
You'd understand how faithful I am.

1053
01:02:07,796 --> 01:02:09,696
I'd better not to be paralysed.

1054
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:12,595
You'd better be drowning
and I'd save you.

1055
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:15,395
You'd be drowning and I'd save you.

1056
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:18,004
I can swim. Petya!

1057
01:02:19,774 --> 01:02:23,005
Your declaration hasn't been accepted.
Careful!

1058
01:02:23,178 --> 01:02:25,544
Are you alright?

1059
01:02:25,714 --> 01:02:30,947
Then I'd like a Chechen kidnap you.
And I'd save you without forces.

1060
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,815
- It's a very bad idea.
- Why?

1061
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:38,085
If a Chechen kidnaps me
I'd be raped for sure.

1062
01:02:38,426 --> 01:02:40,519
Who told you that?

1063
01:02:40,695 --> 01:02:43,459
But if I'm raped,
I'd have to commit a suicide.

1064
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:46,533
Because I won't be able
not to suffer afterthat.

1065
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:49,795
Your declaration hasn't been accepted.

1066
01:02:51,072 --> 01:02:52,369
Let's continue thinking.

1067
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,633
Stop thinking.
I'll tell you how it will end.

1068
01:02:54,843 --> 01:02:55,673
How?

1069
01:02:55,844 --> 01:02:58,142
You'll both
end up in a mental hospital.

1070
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,016
- Why?
- And I'll bring mashed potatoes to you.

1071
01:03:01,016 --> 01:03:02,711
And take for a walk at the weekends.

1072
01:03:02,884 --> 01:03:05,182
No, you won't do that.

1073
01:03:06,788 --> 01:03:09,188
- Olga, please, take it.
- Are you insane?

1074
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:10,923
No, take it.

1075
01:03:11,126 --> 01:03:13,151
Where are you going?

1076
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:16,020
What are you doing? Stop him!

1077
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:18,825
- Olya, calm down.
- Please, stop him.

1078
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:21,730
- Don't leave us.
- Do something, Lyosha.

1079
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:25,132
Give me my watch back.

1080
01:03:26,007 --> 01:03:28,202
I gave you my watch
so you could keep it for me.

1081
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,534
- Give my watch back.
- I won't.

1082
01:03:30,745 --> 01:03:33,646
- Olya, I changed my mind.
- I won't give it back.

1083
01:03:33,848 --> 01:03:37,045
I changed my mind.
Give my watch back.

1084
01:03:59,774 --> 01:04:03,642
And at the end of the hour
as usual the traffic situation.

1085
01:04:04,145 --> 01:04:09,515
Heavy traffic at Tuchkovy bridge,
at the big avenue in both directions.

1086
01:04:10,118 --> 01:04:11,779
Information for drivers.

1087
01:04:11,953 --> 01:04:14,888
According to forecast,
heavy rains are expected in the evening.

1088
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,990
Be careful while you drive.

1089
01:04:17,192 --> 01:04:20,787
Oleg, who Zenit plays with?

1090
01:04:20,962 --> 01:04:23,692
I don't know.
I think with Spartak.

1091
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:27,459
I can imagine
what's going to be afterthe game.

1092
01:05:01,202 --> 01:05:04,171
Stop it! Yourtickets?

1093
01:05:05,874 --> 01:05:07,637
Take it easy.

1094
01:05:09,311 --> 01:05:11,973
- Please, let us in.
- Don't worry, we'll step back.

1095
01:05:12,147 --> 01:05:14,012
Please, let us in. We'll buy tickets.

1096
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,021
I told you it's not scary.

1097
01:05:23,191 --> 01:05:24,920
First of all it wasn't you,
it was Petya.

1098
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:26,754
- OK, Petya. Does it matter?
- Now we have justice.

1099
01:05:26,928 --> 01:05:29,726
You are so cool.
I didn't expect that. So great!

1100
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:31,798
Football is the most
exciting thing in the world.

1101
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:34,298
- Are you a fan?
- Of course not.

1102
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:36,569
Petya is crazy himself, like they are.

1103
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:39,536
- I'm not a fan of Zenit.
- What team are you a fan of?

1104
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:42,209
- I would tell you, but you'll be beaten.
- Spartak?

1105
01:05:43,645 --> 01:05:45,169
Of Brazil team.

1106
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,541
That's good. My friend is a fan
of the Brazil team too.

1107
01:05:47,716 --> 01:05:50,617
I like a young one.
Sychyov is his name.

1108
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:53,777
He is OK.
Nervous a little, like Alexey.

1109
01:05:53,955 --> 01:05:55,889
The star of my heart is Roberto Carlos.

1110
01:05:56,057 --> 01:06:00,687
- Who is that you friend?
- A very good man.

1111
01:06:00,862 --> 01:06:02,193
You'll meet him one day.

1112
01:06:02,397 --> 01:06:04,331
Guys, next time
we're going to football. Alright?

1113
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:07,964
Anyway, you told me
that yourfriend is a horse.

1114
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:10,137
???

1115
01:06:10,338 --> 01:06:11,965
No, she really told me about horses.

1116
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:14,073
Let's stop talking about horses.
Isn't that so hard?

1117
01:06:14,242 --> 01:06:15,800
I'm sorry.

1118
01:06:15,977 --> 01:06:17,774
- I didn't know that.
- You didn't?

1119
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:19,173
So tell me about yourfriend.

1120
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:25,946
Very interesting. When did you meet?

1121
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:29,351
- Stop it. Later!
- I don't wanna meet him.

1122
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:31,659
She trusts you and you don't like that.

1123
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,024
No, I don't. Why should I be glad
to her new friends?

1124
01:06:36,197 --> 01:06:38,324
- Don't spoil my good mood.
- Where have you got that good mood?

1125
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,327
Maybe there was some happiness
in my life.

1126
01:06:40,702 --> 01:06:42,829
What did she tell you?

1127
01:06:43,104 --> 01:06:45,299
- Stop it, Lyosha.
- What did she tell you?

1128
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,666
- I don't ask you what she tells you.
- She tells me that she loves me.

1129
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:50,777
She loves me and not you.

1130
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:52,207
What did you tell her?

1131
01:06:52,414 --> 01:06:54,279
She told you that she loves you?
The same what she told me?

1132
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:56,713
- Are you looking fortroubles?
- Stop it, both!

1133
01:06:58,286 --> 01:07:00,754
Guys, stop it! Are you insane?

1134
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:03,382
Stop it, please!

1135
01:07:05,393 --> 01:07:07,384
This is my fault.

1136
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:10,464
I can explain you everything.

1137
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,824
Stop it, guys! Stop it, Lyosha!

1138
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:16,460
You are like kids.

1139
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:19,067
Guys, stop it!

1140
01:07:23,812 --> 01:07:25,370
- I'll kill you now.
- Calm down!

1141
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:28,443
Stop it! I can't take it anymore.

1142
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,982
What do you want?

1143
01:07:35,156 --> 01:07:37,886
Did you tell him you love him?

1144
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:40,323
- Olya?
- What a childish jealousy?

1145
01:07:40,495 --> 01:07:43,328
Jealousy has nothing to do with it.

1146
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:46,126
Let's go both.
I can explain you everything.

1147
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:49,134
You both are fools and compete idiots.

1148
01:07:49,737 --> 01:07:51,728
Are you going or not?

1149
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:55,205
I'm not going
until you explain me everything.

1150
01:07:56,177 --> 01:07:58,907
- Olga, are you with him or with me?
- I'm with the King Elisey.

1151
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,308
- What?
- Nothing.

1152
01:08:00,482 --> 01:08:02,313
- Stop fooling around.
- I won't.

1153
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:06,919
- Olga, did you tell me that love me?
- Yes, I did.

1154
01:08:07,088 --> 01:08:08,715
What did you tell him?

1155
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:11,290
I told him
to behave with you like a man.

1156
01:08:11,459 --> 01:08:14,792
And he did. And you were like a kid.

1157
01:08:15,497 --> 01:08:17,465
- Really?
- Yes.

1158
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:21,199
Why didn't you tell me that?

1159
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:24,896
Firstly that was not my secret.
Secondly you would've done that anyway.

1160
01:08:25,173 --> 01:08:27,073
OK, let's go.

1161
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:30,774
Olya, are you angry?

1162
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:33,004
No, I'm not.
Just don't wanna talk to you.

1163
01:08:33,181 --> 01:08:36,150
- But you want to talk to Petya.
- Yes, he's a man. Yes, I do.

1164
01:08:36,317 --> 01:08:38,285
- Petya is a man?
- Yes.

1165
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:41,114
- Olga, yes. I'm an idiot.
- Yeah, no doubts.

1166
01:08:42,123 --> 01:08:44,523
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1167
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:46,292
I told you to calm down.

1168
01:08:46,494 --> 01:08:48,394
- There was something else you told me.
- Yes, there was.

1169
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:50,155
Yes, yes.

1170
01:08:50,365 --> 01:08:53,061
Olya, you wanted
to tell us something, didn't you?

1171
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:55,759
- Yes, I did.
- Tell us.

1172
01:08:57,138 --> 01:08:59,333
I'm sorry,
but I didn't have time to make it up.

1173
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:04,736
Guys, I had to stop you in some way.

1174
01:09:13,021 --> 01:09:15,353
- Shit.
- Turn it off.

1175
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:26,967
Yes. What do you want?

1176
01:09:27,168 --> 01:09:29,193
I told you. Soon.

1177
01:09:29,404 --> 01:09:31,463
You promised not to call me.
That's it.

1178
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:35,236
Don't you understand? Get lost!

1179
01:09:39,447 --> 01:09:42,439
- Who was that?
- A relative.

1180
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:44,175
You're too cruel with relatives.

1181
01:09:44,385 --> 01:09:46,353
Whatever.

1182
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,876
Actually it's great,
when men fight because of you.

1183
01:10:09,043 --> 01:10:12,501
That's because you're bad
as all women.

1184
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:15,281
Malakhova!

1185
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,008
And all men are idiots.

1186
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:18,846
I don't know about all,
but we both are for sure.

1187
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,315
I agree with that.

1188
01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:23,388
The only thing I didn't like,
that in films fighters do that nice,

1189
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:25,422
but you both are so red and ridiculous.

1190
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:28,187
You are so good! I'm so proud of you!

1191
01:10:28,396 --> 01:10:31,490
- And I'm so fateful.
- Stop showing off, Malakhova!

1192
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:34,334
- Don't do that. Do you hear me?
- I do what I want to do.

1193
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:37,470
It's so great, so great.

1194
01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:51,911
- Hello. Yes, yes.
- Who is that? Who is that?

1195
01:10:55,023 --> 01:10:57,082
From now on
nobody will call me, I swear.

1196
01:10:57,258 --> 01:11:01,854
- Do you want that?
- I want nobody to call you.

1197
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,528
Are you crazy?

1198
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:11,935
Let's run there.

1199
01:11:12,106 --> 01:11:13,869
Olya, come here.

1200
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:23,172
Guys, I am the happiest girl
in the world! That's true.

1201
01:11:23,351 --> 01:11:27,151
Like in an adventure novel.
I'm going to declare my will.

1202
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:31,189
- You are so insolent.
- Quiet. Don't interrupt me.

1203
01:11:33,294 --> 01:11:36,161
Lyosha, my baby. You are a very nice,
charming poet.

1204
01:11:36,364 --> 01:11:38,332
It doesn't matter
if you write poetry or not.

1205
01:11:38,499 --> 01:11:41,229
I don't think you do,
but anyway you're a poet.

1206
01:11:41,402 --> 01:11:47,204
I'm very glad we met today.
This is a great luck! It's a luck!

1207
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:50,535
You are the real example of a hero.
It's very rare.

1208
01:11:50,712 --> 01:11:53,909
There is not enough
tenderness in this world.

1209
01:11:54,082 --> 01:11:57,916
I know that if one wants to be like you,
he should be braver and more courageous.

1210
01:11:58,086 --> 01:11:59,485
And you are like you are.

1211
01:11:59,654 --> 01:12:01,144
And you have nothing
to share with yourfriend Pyotr.

1212
01:12:01,355 --> 01:12:04,085
Because
you and he are the real friends.

1213
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:06,590
Do you realize that?
You and he are the real friends.

1214
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:08,558
Olya, stop it.

1215
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,965
Don't interrupt me.

1216
01:12:14,402 --> 01:12:16,336
Now you listen.

1217
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:18,472
Pyotr, now you listen.

1218
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:22,501
I want to tell you,
that I'm not insolent.

1219
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:28,239
I'm just proud that such a strong
and brave man paid his attention to me.

1220
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:32,281
Because people like you don't
pay attention to anyone.

1221
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:37,288
Do you realize that you have
the best temper which man can have?

1222
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:42,360
You are very serious,
even though you make a lot of jokes.

1223
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,464
But you are very serious to life.

1224
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:47,692
I'm telling you, that's right.
Because you'll win if you are serious.

1225
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:49,593
You will win.

1226
01:12:49,804 --> 01:12:51,362
- Will I?
- You will win.

1227
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:53,404
I'm telling you that. Guys!

1228
01:12:55,543 --> 01:12:58,011
Guys, I'm so happy!

1229
01:12:58,179 --> 01:13:01,307
You can't imagine. I'm the happiest
girl in Saint-Petersburg.

1230
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:03,643
I'm the happiest
girl in Saint-Petersburg.

1231
01:13:03,818 --> 01:13:05,183
Olya, where are you going to?

1232
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:11,553
Olya, we are going to celebrate
our meeting as much as we can.

1233
01:13:11,759 --> 01:13:13,351
Follow me!

1234
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,323
Olya, where are you going to?

1235
01:13:17,498 --> 01:13:19,693
Stop, wait!

1236
01:13:37,318 --> 01:13:39,309
Why did you bring us here, Malakhova?

1237
01:13:53,768 --> 01:13:56,236
Daddy!

1238
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:02,606
Daddy!

1239
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:09,641
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

1240
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:13,185
- Why did shout at me on the phone?
- Daddy, you got into a mess.

1241
01:14:13,354 --> 01:14:16,755
- Why is that?
- You lost, do you know that?

1242
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:19,854
- I always lose with you.
- You really did lose.

1243
01:14:20,228 --> 01:14:22,560
You are totally frozen. Totally wet.

1244
01:14:23,097 --> 01:14:24,257
Throughout.

1245
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:26,332
I've got a gift foryou.

1246
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,161
Is that all?
Do you think that's enough?

1247
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:30,270
This is all for now.
Come on, you gotta change.

1248
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:33,269
- We were in the street, it was raining.
- That's why you need to change.

1249
01:14:33,441 --> 01:14:35,341
I wanna drink something. I want Martini.

1250
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:37,204
- Order it, please.
- I'll do that. Don't worry.

1251
01:14:37,378 --> 01:14:41,109
- I'm gonna show you them now.
- I'll see them by myself. Come on. Go.

1252
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:51,252
Hi.

1253
01:14:51,759 --> 01:14:53,283
- Vsevolod.
- Alexey.

1254
01:14:53,461 --> 01:14:54,621
Nice to meet you.

1255
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:56,126
- Petya.
- Vsevolod.

1256
01:14:58,366 --> 01:14:59,594
I'm sorry?

1257
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,563
She's not allowed to sit.

1258
01:15:01,736 --> 01:15:04,364
- Now she can.
- She has problems with her spinal column.

1259
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:05,834
Her spinal column?
What's wrong with it?

1260
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:08,698
- She fell, broke her spinal column.
- In the street?

1261
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:10,434
I forbade herto wearthose hills.

1262
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:12,476
Don't worry. She fell off a horse.

1263
01:15:12,647 --> 01:15:14,171
What horse?

1264
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:16,908
Guys, what are you talking about?
She hasn't seen a horse in her life.

1265
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:20,414
She's afraid of animals.
What are you talking about?

1266
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:23,523
- What's going on?
- Take it easy.

1267
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:27,851
And who are you, by the way?

1268
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:30,558
And you?

1269
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:32,492
- Is it an interrogation?
- Just a second.

1270
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,692
- Who are you?
- No, wait.

1271
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:36,700
Yes, sure,
I need to explain. I got you.

1272
01:15:40,308 --> 01:15:42,208
Guys.

1273
01:15:42,443 --> 01:15:43,705
Boys.

1274
01:15:43,878 --> 01:15:46,813
We have a wedding in a week.

1275
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:51,445
And afterthe wedding
she wanted to go somewhere.

1276
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:54,281
I wanted to go
to our country house afterthe wedding.

1277
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:57,447
I've got a nice house there.
Very nice house.

1278
01:15:58,326 --> 01:16:00,624
And she wants Tibet, the Himalayas.

1279
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:02,160
Mountains.

1280
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,422
To walk.

1281
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:07,431
I asked her what she was talking about.
You have to walk in the Himalayas.

1282
01:16:07,635 --> 01:16:10,297
You have to walk a lot there.
Heels won't work there.

1283
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:12,962
She doesn't move
in the city except car.

1284
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:17,744
From carto bar, from barto cafe,
from cafe to car again.

1285
01:16:17,912 --> 01:16:22,178
And I explained her, there are not
bars and restaurants in mountains.

1286
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,783
And there are not cars either.

1287
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:26,249
You gotta walk there. Walk! On foot!

1288
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,253
And she is lazy as hell!

1289
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:32,960
She said she wanted to the Himalayas
and she said she would walk.

1290
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:37,889
I won't sit down and bring two witnesses
who tell that I walked and never sat.

1291
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:42,258
So she won. But she is very
stubborn and very persistent.

1292
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:45,701
So we had a bet and I lost and she won.

1293
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:47,602
So that means
you called her all the time?

1294
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:48,969
Yes I did.

1295
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:52,245
Let's be informal, ok?

1296
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:57,549
I called.

1297
01:16:57,718 --> 01:17:02,314
And I saw you in the city,
not farfrom the cathedral, in the car.

1298
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,949
- I remember.
- You could've hit us.

1299
01:17:05,693 --> 01:17:08,890
Stop wrangling, OK?
Let's have a drink.

1300
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,361
I have been waiting
foryou for a long time.

1301
01:17:11,565 --> 01:17:13,795
Let's have a drink there.
Let's go to the bar.

1302
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:15,491
What are you dreaming of?

1303
01:17:16,437 --> 01:17:18,701
What are you gonna drink?

1304
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:21,032
Strychnia, please.

1305
01:17:42,063 --> 01:17:45,897
Hey, babe. Look at my back.
Is everything OK there?

1306
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,793
- Yes.
- Look, please!

1307
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,431
Are you OK?

1308
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,610
- Everything's fine.
- You sure?

1309
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:06,847
I don't understand one thing.
Why didn't she tell me at once?

1310
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:08,682
It's logical.

1311
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:12,017
If she had told you about the wedding
do you think you would've walked with her?

1312
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:14,054
I don't think so.

1313
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:18,354
- Very unique.
- Only unique people can survive.

1314
01:18:18,566 --> 01:18:20,830
But she is a real unique object.

1315
01:18:21,035 --> 01:18:23,435
Let's drink one more time.

1316
01:18:26,474 --> 01:18:27,998
One more, please.

1317
01:18:29,743 --> 01:18:32,576
Let's bowl. I have a lane ordered.

1318
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:37,046
Then let's go to have a supper.
I ordered a very good place.

1319
01:18:40,654 --> 01:18:43,555
My treat. I lost.

1320
01:18:43,757 --> 01:18:48,694
You can't even imagine
how much you lost.

1321
01:18:50,498 --> 01:18:52,523
Is that a hint or something?

1322
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,567
That would be a hint,
but it's too late.

1323
01:18:57,104 --> 01:18:58,901
Are you kidding?

1324
01:19:01,509 --> 01:19:04,103
Daddy, could've you bought
something simpler?

1325
01:19:08,482 --> 01:19:09,642
I think it's cool.

1326
01:19:09,817 --> 01:19:11,944
You'll be the most important
at the tomorrow's reception.

1327
01:19:12,153 --> 01:19:14,417
- I'm not going.
- Who asked you?

1328
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:16,488
- I'm not going.
- Yes, you will.

1329
01:19:16,657 --> 01:19:18,784
I told you, I'm not.

1330
01:19:20,461 --> 01:19:22,122
Guys, why don't you talk?

1331
01:19:22,463 --> 01:19:24,727
Does it look good on me?

1332
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:27,959
It's not the word.
You should always wear it.

1333
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:31,130
In the street, to shops.

1334
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:33,531
Forfootball it's nice too.

1335
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:37,040
By the way, Daddy,
take herto a football game.

1336
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:38,838
- She likes football a lot.
- Are you mad at me?

1337
01:19:39,013 --> 01:19:40,105
- Me?
- Want a Martini?

1338
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,108
- I'm delighted.
- One red Martini, please.

1339
01:19:43,651 --> 01:19:45,881
- Have you explained them?
- Two times.

1340
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:47,849
- Guys, I can explain that.
- No, Olya.

1341
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:49,751
It took you a day to explain everything.

1342
01:19:49,924 --> 01:19:51,755
I got it, I got it.

1343
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:53,756
- It was a practical joke.
- Yes it was.

1344
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,885
- It wasn't a joke. It was a meanness.
- It wasn't a meanness. It was a joke.

1345
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:58,691
When I met you
I didn't think it was going to be so...

1346
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:01,562
You know what she told me?
She always fantasize.

1347
01:20:01,769 --> 01:20:04,966
- About her grandfather's inheritance.
- Would you shut up?

1348
01:20:05,172 --> 01:20:07,640
She's going to Moscow tonight.
She's going to Moscow.

1349
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:10,174
That's why you returned money.

1350
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:12,808
Like a honesty, nobility.

1351
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,039
To play games,
but without money involved.

1352
01:20:15,216 --> 01:20:17,810
I even thought that you...

1353
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:20,646
Are you mad at her?

1354
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:23,949
You mad at her?
She is only 5 years old. She's a child.

1355
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:26,922
- You're not right.
- Drink Martini.

1356
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:30,888
She lied to you.

1357
01:20:31,098 --> 01:20:33,532
If she made something up,
but only because she believes in that.

1358
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:35,668
Really, she does.

1359
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:38,429
She is a child
and she have childish jokes.

1360
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:40,733
You're not right.

1361
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:43,468
Let's get out of here.
Don't wanna stay.

1362
01:20:44,812 --> 01:20:46,609
Don't go into hysteric.

1363
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,442
- I don't wanna sit her.
- I've known herfor 3 years.

1364
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:54,181
- You don't know anything.
- But you know a lot, as I see.

1365
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:56,546
Daddy, let's drink this and we'll go.

1366
01:20:56,724 --> 01:20:58,521
Cheers.

1367
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:02,494
We present you our condolence.
We really have to go.

1368
01:21:02,663 --> 01:21:04,255
You won't go anywhere.

1369
01:21:04,598 --> 01:21:07,226
Let's go, Petya. Come on, let's go.

1370
01:21:10,671 --> 01:21:12,696
Move it!

1371
01:21:13,274 --> 01:21:16,641
Yeah, we are very lucky.
Incredibly lucky.

1372
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:18,141
- An unforgettable day.
- Wait.

1373
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:21,577
- Don't dare to leave.
- I will always rememberyou, Olya.

1374
01:21:21,815 --> 01:21:24,579
I didn't know that such people exist.

1375
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:28,244
- Your nerves are really strong.
- You don't understand me.

1376
01:21:28,589 --> 01:21:30,250
- Can you listen to me?
- What don't I understand?

1377
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,751
- I didn't lie to you, I didn't.
- You didn't?

1378
01:21:32,926 --> 01:21:35,087
Petya, I didn't lie to you.

1379
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:36,957
I'm telling that
looking into your eyes.

1380
01:21:37,131 --> 01:21:38,758
- Ljust didn't know.
- What didn't you know?

1381
01:21:38,932 --> 01:21:40,763
That you are getting married?
You didn't know that?

1382
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:43,095
You didn't know about that?
What are you talking? Listen to yourself.

1383
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,295
Listen to me. Stop yelling!

1384
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:49,234
- Guys, is it OK that I'm here?
- I'm real honest. I didn't lie.

1385
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:53,137
Petya, tell him
everything's gonna be alright.

1386
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:56,238
- I swear.
- Quiet!

1387
01:21:56,817 --> 01:21:58,546
- Shut up!
- Let me go!

1388
01:21:58,686 --> 01:21:59,983
Don't you understand, he's leaving?

1389
01:22:00,154 --> 01:22:02,315
- Calm down!
- He's leaving. Can't you understand?

1390
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:04,988
Let him go. It's over.

1391
01:22:05,192 --> 01:22:07,285
Calm down.

1392
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:15,529
I really love you.

1393
01:22:21,308 --> 01:22:23,776
I love you too.

1394
01:22:24,044 --> 01:22:26,569
My sweet girl.

1395
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:30,016
Very much. Everything's gonna be OK.

1396
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:34,652
- We'll go soon.
- Go forthem.

1397
01:22:35,422 --> 01:22:38,858
- I told you to go forthem.
- Calm down I told you!

1398
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:42,257
Do you realize that I deceived them.
I'm a bastard, I'm a bitch.

1399
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:44,288
That's OK. Calm down.

1400
01:22:44,665 --> 01:22:48,066
- I deceived you too.
- Me? I can forget about that.

1401
01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:52,729
It's so good with you.

1402
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,277
Run afterthem, please.

1403
01:22:58,445 --> 01:23:00,845
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I'm not leaving you.

1404
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:03,847
We'll go and have a ride. Don't worry.

1405
01:23:13,427 --> 01:23:16,954
Where do you think you were going?
Are you blind?

1406
01:23:17,131 --> 01:23:22,433
What are you sitting there?
Come out and look what you've done.

1407
01:23:22,836 --> 01:23:26,135
It's yourfault!
Look where you go!

1408
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:29,742
Where have you got
your driving license?

1409
01:23:29,943 --> 01:23:31,843
It's none of your business!

1410
01:23:32,746 --> 01:23:35,306
Either I call for cops
oryou pay me here.

1411
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:38,014
What should I pay for? Forthis?

1412
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:40,153
Your car is not worth of my bumper.

1413
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,915
You'll pay? What? Me?

1414
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:48,958
- Learn how to drive first.
- You'd better learn, not me.
