## PICO-8 Specifications ##

- Cartridge size: 32k
- Sound: 4 channel, 64 definable chip blerps
- Code: Lua (max 8192 tokens of code) 
- Sprites: Single bank of 128 8x8 sprites (+128 shared)
- Map: 128x32 8-bit cels (+128x32 shared)

## PICO-8 Quirks ##
Common gotchas to watch out for:
- The bottom half of the spritesheet and bottom half of the map occupy the
  same memory.
  - Best use only one or the other if you're unsure how this works.
  - The second half of the sprite sheet (banks 2 and 3), and the bottom half
    of the map share the same cartridge space. It's up to you how you use the
    data, but be aware that drawing on the second half of the sprite sheet
    could clobber data on the map and vice versa.
- PICO-8 numbers only go up to 32767.99.
  - If you add 1 to a counter each frame, it will overflow after around 18
    minutes!
- Lua arrays are 1-based by default, not 0-based.
  - FOREACH starts at T[1], not T[0].
- `cos()` and `sin()` take `0..1` instead of `0..PI*2`, and `sin()` is
  inverted.
- sgn(0) returns 1.
- Toggle fullscreen: use alt-enter on OSX (command-F is used for searching
  text).
- When you want to export a `.png` cartridge, use `SAVE`, not `EXPORT`.
  `EXPORT` will save only the spritesheet!

## SPLORE Keyboard Shortcuts ##
- Favorite a cart: `F` (while it is selected in cartridge view)

## Code Editor Shortcuts ##
Hold shift to select (or click and drag with mouse)
- `CTRL-X`, `CTRL-C`, `CTRL-V` to cut copy or paste selected
-	`CTRL-Z`, `CTRL-Y` to undo, redo
- `CTRL-F` to search for text
- `CTRL-G` to repeat the last search again

- `ALT-UP`, `ALT-DOWN` to navigate to the previous, next function

At the bottom right of the code editor you can see how many tokens have been
used. One program can have a maximum of 8192 tokens. Each token is a word (e.g.
variable name) or operator. Pairs of brackets, and strings count as 1 token.
commas, periods, LOCALs, semi-colons, ENDs, and comments are not counted.

To enter special characters that represent buttons, use `SHIFT-L,R,U,D,O,X`.

You can find some settings in config.txt. Edit the file when PICO-8 is not
running.

- Windows: `C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/config.txt`
- OSX: `/Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/config.txt`
- Linux: `~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/config.txt`

Use the `-home` switch (below) to use a different path to store config.txt and
other data.

## Lua filesystem functions ##
To import or export the spritesheet as a .png:

    import("blah.png")    --  expects 128x128 png and colour-fits
                          --  to the pico-8 palette
    export("blah.png")    --  use folder() to locate the exported png

To export sound effects or music:

    export("blah.wav")    --  export music from the current
                          --  pattern (when editor mode is MUSIC)
    export("blah.wav")    --  export the current SFX

    export("blah%d.wav")  --  exports all of the SFXs
                          --  as blah0.wav, blah1.wav .. blah63.wav
