# Password Guidelines #

1) Passwords must be at least 12 characters long

2) Passwords must contain characters from at least three of the following four
groups:
  - lower case letters (a-z)
  - upper case letters (A-Z)
  - numbers (0-9)
  - non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation; `!@#$%^&*()_+={}[]|\/?,.<>~`)

3) Passwords must:
  - NOT be a dictionary word or proper name
  - NOT contain any part of your real name or account name

4) Password length is more secure than password complexity. Itâ€™s better to
have a longer password with less complexity (i.e. 15+ characters) than a 7-8
character with lots of complexity. 

5) Use different passwords for UCSD accounts from other non-UCSD access (e.g.,
personal ISP account, option trading, benefits, etc.).

6)  When possible, use different passwords for different UCSD systems. For
example, select one password for Active Directory, and use a different password
for Single Sign On. 

7) Do not share UCSD passwords with anyone, including administrative assistants
or secretaries. All passwords are to be treated as sensitive, confidential UCSD
information.

8) Passwords should never be written down or stored on-line without encryption.

9) Do not reveal a password in email, chat, or other electronic communication.
If you need to transmit the password electronically, send passwords via SMS
text messaging.

10) Do not hint at the format of a password (e.g., "my family name").

11) Do not reveal a password on questionnaires or security forms.

12) If someone demands a password, direct them to the UCSD Security Team
(security@ucsd.edu). 

# How to make a strong, memorable password #
A handy way to make a difficult-to-guess password is to crush together a short
phrase or common words, to make an uncommon or nonexistent word that you can
easily remember. Then, replace letters with punctuation and numbers that look
like the letters, and capitalize a couple letters. For example:

bad doggie becomes `B&d=D0g3`
great days becomes `gr@tD@ys`
dark light becomes `d@RRKLy+`
beer keg becomes `bEur=kEg`
don't have a cow, man becomes `dNtHv@cw`

Another way of creating a memorable password is to think of a sentence that you
can remember. This will be the basis of your strong password or pass phrase.
Use a memorable sentence, such as "MysonAidenisthreeyearsold".

If you can't use a passphrase like the example above, convert it to a password.
Take the first letter of each word of the sentence that you've created to
create a new, nonsensical word. Using the example above, you'd get: "msaityo".

Add complexity by mixing uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. It is
valuable to use some letter swapping or misspellings as well. For instance, in
the pass phrase above, consider misspelling Aiden's name, or substituting the
word "three" for the number 3. There are many possible substitutions, and the
longer the sentence, the more complex your password can be. Your pass phrase
might become "MySoNAyd3Nis3yeeRsold." If the computer or online system will not
support a pass phrase, use the same technique on the shorter password. This
might yield a password like "MsAiy3yo".

Finally, substitute some special characters. You can use symbols that look like
letters, combine words and other ways to make the password more complex. Using
these tricks, we create a pass phrase of "MySoN8Ni$3yeeR$old" or a password
(using the first letter of each word) "M$8ni3y0".

Don't use any of the password examples listed above; undoubtedly someone will
be trying all of these just to see whose accounts they can commandeer.
