# Business logic/processing #

# Reports and other outputs #

# External interfaces - connections to other components or systems #

# Internationalization #

# Accessibility #
Making the application useable by people with disabilities

# User administration #

# Billing users #

# Supported platforms #
Client browsers, client API access, internal API access, what platform the
project will run on

# Installation # 

# Capacity #
How many users will be able to use the application

# Conversion #
Importing/exporting from other systems

# System testing #

# Documentation #

# Training #

# Use cases #
Detailed descriptions of interactions between an actor and the application that
results in something of value. Use cases are little stories, with characters
and a plot, so they're much more understandable by people for whom the
application is being built
