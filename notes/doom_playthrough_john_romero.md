- Always build the first level last in chronological order, since you will
  have the experience of building all of the other maps before making the
  first level, and by then you should be really good at making levels
- Iterative play-design process
  - Build, then play
- What's the coolest thing to see when the player enters a level?
  - Possibilities; where can the player go, what do they see right away?
- Every level is doable with a pistol start
  - If you die in a level and lose all of your stuff, you have to be able to
    play through the level somehow once you respawn in that level
- Lights out and monsters appear after getting a valuable item, like a door
  key
- Make an area have multiple uses/purposes
  - How do I maximize the design of an area so that I can reuse that area in
    different ways
  - Romero uses the example of _Legend of Zelda_, which apparently requires a
    lot of exploration and has levels with areas that are used multiple times
    during the exploration of that level
    - Opening area with bushes, the bushes have a Lamp of Fire, and if you
      burn the bushes down, there's a dungeon opening
- Beginning levels should be designed so that they're somewhat short, and can
  elevate the chance of finishing the level successfully, so that players will
  want to play through it to the next levels
- **E1M5** is Romero's favorite deathmatch level
