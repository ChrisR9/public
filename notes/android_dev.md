## Android Virtual Devices ##
A virtual device needs to be set up in Android Studio before you can try and
run projects.

To set up a virtual device, click on the AVD icon in the toolbar of the IDE
(looks like a phone with an android icon peeking up over the bottom), or
navigate to `Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager`
